# Social Media Apps Opinions

The goal of the project was to analyse customer opinions about five social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok and Twitter.

The analysis of the entire corpus, after the preprocessing performed earlier, showed that the most common words are: like, post, people and account. These are the main aspects that have been assessed by users in the comments.
In the next step of the analysis, comments for each application were divided according to the topics. The first topic defines: app evaluation, the second is: community, third: user experience, and fourth: features. 
As a result of the sentiment analysis, a list of positive, neutral and negative comments was obtained for each application in individual topics.
