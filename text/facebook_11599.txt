Poor maintenance of watch feature
I watch facebook videos a lot and it makes me angry when I’m trying to watch videos I want to watch on Watch and nothing I like or am even interested in shows up. They can have all this data about me but cannot figure out that I don’t want to watch the same dumb livestream that I’ve skipped past for days and that I want to watch videos similar to the ones I’ve spent hours binging. Not only that, but if I select that I want to watch just videos and not livestreams from the filters, it still shows almost entirely livestreams in recommended videos. Lastly, the fact that it has been probably a month at least since the picture in picture feature has been out on iPhone and this app is pretty much the last one not compatible when it’s trying to push its Watch feature is annoying at best and maddening at worst. Please fix this and make it an actually usable feature for people who want to enjoy content.


Edit: I was looking under the Gaming tab because I thought it was the watch tab which is my fault because my app is in a different language, but I realized you can change up your dashboard a bit and instead of being able to just enable and disable the Gaming and Groups features, why can’t I switch the gaming part with the Watch feature instead? That would be a huge improvement for the app.

App is useless
Facebook had become basically unusable for months. Many users repeatedly post the same issues without any response or resolution from Facebook. I’m an IT professional it appears the app is incapable of keeping up with the volume, maybe server issues. The app freezes constantly and crashes. Isn’t working at all while on wireless have to turn off my wireless to have any hope of being able to review my notifications. Anytime I get a new notifications it throws me out of where I am and back to the beginning of my notifications. Then I have to start all over again paging through the hundreds of notifications I receive to try to find where I previously left off which is next to impossible due to the endless freezing and crashes. Notifications I previously reviewed continue to show unread making it impossible to figure out which ones I’ve reviewed. The app has gotten totally frustrating to use to the point it’s taking me several hours a day just to get through notifications, there aren’t enough hours in the day to deal with Facebook which is slowing becoming a full time job to deal with. It’s a good thing it’s free because no one would pay for software that doesn’t work and provides no customer service or issue resolution. They constantly make so called updates that break previously working functionality. The updates are unwanted by the users, what we want is a reliable app not a bunch of bells and whistles that do nothing to improve the user experience.

Ok so.
OK so I had a account on Facebook and I pretty sure somebody hacked it and with saying that I can not login the email that it says that I logged in with is not my email at all because one I know all my emails and this is not one of them I also know all my password because I have the written down and it’s saying it wrong I have tried to email Facebook and no one has answered me and that was over a month ago Um so with all the passwords I have put in and everything nothing is working so I keep trying right and the page like disappeared for awhile and today December 5 I some how found it back so I am now trying to get back in to it and I can’t still I’m so mad that it’s not working obviously Facebook is no help and they are not doing there job I literally just want to get back in my old account because I have so many friends and pictures on there. The one person on there is a old friend that passed away and the hole family has a thing where we posted on there happy birthday and all that but that doesn’t matter I want to fight out how to change my password on there but good old Facebook can’t answer some body questions so maybe Facebook well see this and help out? But I don’t recommend getting Facebook because I’m about done with this dumb app because they have me so mad about this hole thing.

Don’t trust this plateform
Hmm ok let’s see where do I begin. Well I used to love fb but these days its just garage. Not to long ago one of the ads they allowed that kept popping up and I was intrigued. I thought I vetted the company and fb enough so I trusted it and made a purchase. Well $125 later and no product. Total scam, Ok well my bad. Fb basically said sorry can’t monitor everything so shop at your own risk.
Jump forward and it’s political season, well guess what I have been censored on posts. One for example (censored as may be disturbing) was a couple singing a rendition of the star spangled banner. Why? Well because it was shared from a conservative fb page, either that or fb has it out for this song lol. Now random posts are removed or censored constantly. So basically they will let some slime ball advertise that’s a scam and stealing money but me I get reviewed everyday.
Also people around me constantly share false info about things and nothing happens. (Those friends are on the liberal side of course)
Also they started a news tab, funny how they will allow news articles that have misleading headlines buit no censoring. As long as it’s liberal news.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m against all censoring in America ( besides the obvious fir children’s sake) however doing things like that to a select group is beyond scary. I don’t promote hate violence or supremacy or anything of the like just love unity country etc and I’m a threat apparently. ????+? later fb

You’re not allowed to be yourself anymore
Facebook used to be a fun place to connect with old school friends and family..a place where I could freely express my unique self. You used to be able to post anything you wanted whether it was true or not, just because you felt like it and nobody really cared! Some things opened up great discussions! Now, everything you share or comment is scrutinized by behind-the-screen random, ghost people. These people have their own opinions and when you freely express yourself like before, your posts or comments will be taken down, blocked or hidden, and all of your audience will be notified that your opinion or posts just happens to be something they personally disagree with. I did a test and posted 2 polar opposite opinions on an issue just to see what they would do, both of them were false news. The fake news I posted about current and political events had 2 distinct viewpoints. The one the ghost person disagreed with, was covered up and labeled as false with a link to an article for my audience to click proving their viewpoint. The other one that was also fake news, fit their personal viewpoint and they never touched it. I personally disagreed with both things I posted but found out quickly what the viewpoint was of the ghost robots behind the screens reading everybody’s personal stuff. Facebook is NOT a good thing!!

TIRED!!!
Whatever happened to our First Amendment rights? I’m sick and tired of being censored, this shouldn’t happen in America ever, not on an American owned and based company/app! And all bc my political views don’t match up with that of the owner/operator of FB, those that have been the loudest up until now and of the fictional news media. I’m also tired of unofficial election results being shoved down my throat, with those folks knowing good and well the results are not official, forgetting that some ppl do know a bit about political science and when and how the elections work!! I’m tired of posts of my friends and mine being labeled as violent when they’re nothing of the kind all while others who don’t even know me threaten me and others with physical bodily harm and even death bc we support our President!! Posts get flagged or covered completely claiming that “fact checkers” had proven it to be false, number 1 the fake news puts out false info hourly, 2 it’s our right to speak/post what we want, false or not per our 1st amendment, 3 the info being false according to who, the fake news? In other words it’s time for FB to go back to being just an impartial bystander, but I guess I’m forgetting that the owner/operator Mark Zuckerberg is a Marxist, so that’ll never happen I guess, until we overcome the Marxist trying to destroy our Democratic Republic and take back our rights!!

Fascistbook !
Most bias social network. They promote an atmosphere that allows bullying. They have community standards they hide behind while promoting an atmosphere that lets people harass you like sending video recordings or video calls and vulgar bully remarks via messenger. Dirty delete game is rampant with instigators on FB especially those with an agenda to push. It’s gotten really pathetic and many people are moving to Parler and mewe. FB on the other hand won’t allow links to either of those social media networks be put on messenger! They have algorithms kicking back messages with links per many people opening accounts with their competitors. It’s no longer a place to have your own opinions. Just had a suspension for telling off a wack job harassing me for no reason other than telling a poster to ignore her she’s probably a HS student. That resulted in this woman sending me recorded messages on messenger all screwed up high as a kite slurring making racial remarks and threatening me. She then tried to video call and when I took pic of the correspondence and posted it stating I wouldn’t tolerate it she then began posting remarks and sending more comments to my messenger. She dirty deleted when I wrote to her to go do her dope got suspension but this person I get rejected reports doesn’t go against standards?! I’m guessing my conservative cover photo was the cause of their decision making.

Fascistic Censorship
I have had a Facebook profile for several years now and i can personally attest to its steep decline as a whole. Facebook is a platform not publisher. Meaning it is not responsible for what its users post. However, more and more recently Facebook had decided to act as a publisher. It will restrict and censor any profile, article, page, or post that does not align itself with left wing ideology and agendas. Companies like Facebook and Twitter have become merely a propaganda outlet for the Democratic Party, much like mainstream media. Here is the good part!! I live in the greatest, most free and prosperous country in history of the world. I mainly said that because i know leftists hate America so they won't like that part much. Anyway, with Facebook moving to suppress free speech and conservative voices, it was just a matter of time before other companies rose up to fight back against Facebook’s fascistic censorship of anything it doesn’t like. Of these is Parler. Capitalism, baby! I would like to encourage everyone and anyone who reads this to delete Facebook and come over to Parler where your views and beliefs wont be censored and suppressed just because they differ from those of King Zuckerberg’s. So much for the “tolerance of the left”, right? But then again if the left didn’t have double standards, they would have no standards at all. See you on Parler!!

Gross people
Not only does the app crash consistently, removing posts and comments or simply failing to save a post or comment before a crash, they coddle to racists and internet trolls to an obscene degree. For example, a person can call you a discriminatory phrase based on your race, religion, gender, or sexual preference but if you report them after they’ve edited the post, FB will rule in their favor and threaten to freeze your account for making the complaint, as if the rest of the world can’t see what was said in the revision/edit history. More over, a college friend of mine passed years ago while we were in school during my undergrad degree. Her account was hacked by someone who changed the name on the account but posted raunchy pictures of another young woman, requesting money and gift cards in exchange for nudes. I tried reporting the account along with our former college advisor but no category fit. We each explained the situation in followup complaints and via email with zero replies to all. We received a generic response saying the content wasn’t a violation of fb rules, never addressing the fact that we were upset by the stealing of the account by a hacker making money from our dead loved one. We were warned not to submit any more complaints about that account as well by some generic response. Don’t expect them much from them.

Actually I’d say ZERO stars!
Sick of being censored. Sick of your so called “fact checkers.” You and your “fact checkers,” wouldn’t know the truth if it slapped you across the face! Here’s a FACT for you, as of this present day, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!! YOU actually promote FAKE NEWS! I’m sick of Facebook because it’s biased. Distasteful sexual images and videos along with violence from “certain groups of people,” are permitted but we can’t share actual facts, be mind that kids are on this platform. You put a tag on every single one of OUR PRESIDENTS posts which is so disrespectful where respect is due. At first Facebook seemed to bring people together but now it pushes to divide. I do not want to see your ads. I do not want you listening in on my conversations then showing me ads about what I say in private. By January 1, 2020 I will have deleted Facebook for good. Mark Zuckerberg, you should be ashamed of yourself. Your parents should be ashamed of the way you turned out. I doubt I’ll ever come back. I know plenty of people are transitioning away from your platform as well. We’re just sick of it all. If I could choose the old MySpace over Facebook, I definitely would. Tom was way better than you any day. Since the old MySpace isn’t an option, I have found other platforms that I LOVE, like WimKin, Parler, MeWe and more. GOOD BYE FAKEBOOK!

Irritating App
The app has been driving me crazy for months now. If I stay on the Facebook page, it only blacks out once or twice per evening. If I want to read something (my cousin's newspaper article, for instance) posted by my friends, the app blacks out every time and if I want to continue on Facebook, I have to open the app all over again and hope I can find my place. I'm almost ready to delete the darn thing! Wondering if it's worth the frustration! I've written my problems to the staff through Facebook three times and have received no recommendations. Can the app be fixed?


Well, it's about 2 ,months later and nothing has improved. The app still freezes and blacks out. If I try to move from a post to attached info it freezes. Moving down the page to more posts makes it freeze or it blacks out completely. Then I get to start all over opening the app yet again. This is really getting to be more trouble than it's worth. It would be nice if the it people would at least respond in some way. A lot of us are feeling ignored. Not good business practice!

Functional, But Needs a Major Design Change
Facebook is an average social media app that is nice for communicating with friends and family for free (via Messenger). But, with that being said, it is time for Facebook to release a major design update for the mobile app. Often, when I am checking the reactions to my posts on Facebook, the reactions never load, are miscounted, or not updated. This is example number one of why Facebook needs to seriously upgrade. One thing that a lot of Facebook mobile app users have been waiting for is a dark mode for the app! It has been released across multiple platforms, including instagram, which is owned by Facebook. They released a dark mode for desktop users & the Messenger app, and it is beyond time for the mobile users to have the option for dark mode on the Facebook App. One last example of something that Facebook needs to update is it’s variety. Messenger only having a few color-themed backgrounds to choose, for example. Other than a design update, the app is very useful for communication, businesses, memes, inspiration, etc. It is also a good way to pass the time.

Not one of the sheep
This app use to be a great way to stay in touch with old and new friends, post funny pictures and sayings, and most importantly just being yourself. Well now hopefully your friends aren’t conservative because they will stay in Facebook jail, can’t post anything you may think is funny because it “may offend others” well first off my friends know who I am if they are offended by what I post they wouldn’t be my friend and secondly who are you to say what is and isn’t appropriate, oh I forgot y’all are “woke” my bad, lastly good news you can still be your self and post what you want as long as you are a liberal/socialist lord forbid you disagree with the almighty hypocritical Facebook gods (yea that includes you little sheepy Marky) because those people aren’t allowed to be themselves and have fun posting something they think is funny because it’s making fun of their sheep herder??. Not to mention they love to shove the socialist agenda down your throat every time you get on but when it’s something your interested in following there is no notification whatsoever (and yes I looked at the settings). So Mark since your so interested in socialism when can I start receiving my weekly checks you have to much money I think you need to do the socialist thing and give it to people that don’t have it.

Twitter here I Come
I hate Facebook. If I could give Zero stars I would. It’s like school popularity all over again for adults. Only reason I have to have it is cuz I sign into apps with it and I’m so far committed to these apps it would be a huge hassle to start a different account.


I’ve been cyber bullied/harassed/threatened countless times on here but as soon as I respond (fire with Fire), I’m always getting banned/restricted. It’s unreal. Like I seriously hate Facebook and everything it stands for at this point. I can’t wait until a different Social Media provider takes down Facebook. Instagram over Facebook all day any day. Bring back MySpace but FB can get bent for all I care.


Edit: it’s funny I see a lot of the same complaints. Something tells me FB won’t be around for 2030. Ding dong the witch is dead. Facebook doesn’t realize it yet, probably cuz they are full of themselves, but y’all on the downhill swing of things. Enjoy your last run. 1 star reviews are piling up and y’all don’t care. Bullies. But I think it’s time I finally take the plunge and create a Twitter as my primary and use that for my app accounts. Facebook, you had your chances and your nothing but a bully yourself that allows bullies to thrive while restricting the people who simply defend themselves from these bullies, hence, your ALSO A BULLY.

My Account Got Disabled HELP
Ok, since Facebook has no way for us to contact them unless it’s directly through our account, which I currently cannot access, then my email will probably not reach them. Hopefully this will.
DEAR FACEBOOK PEOPLE: So I created an account and a page literally two days ago. I tried doing an ad for my page yesterday, and because I did it too early (I think this is why) my ads account was flagged. I did everything as I was told: I sent in a review request and they fixed the problem, unflagging my ads account, so they sent me an email to confirm that all was well again. However, I cannot access either my account or my page anymore. It’s as if they don’t exist. Apparently the problem was already fixed but I can’t see anything I previously put on my account and page.
Furthermore, I can’t make a new account because my email is tied to my previous account, so I’m pretty much stuck. They tell me that if I need help I should contact the Facebook Support Team but, I repeat, I CANNOT access my account. So I cannot access the FB Support Team.
This is the first time I ever give something a one star review. I don’t mean to be rude but your customer service is very bad. I can’t even properly delete my account, in case it’s not fully gone. So yeah. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP.

Really!
Freedom of free speech not allowed if you don’t agree with them. I have seen more than enough false information that is absolutely allowed with no problems for their narrative but the things I learned in school, you know when history didn’t change so much, and many other things I have seen with my own eyes, is apparently ‘false’ because it makes some really bad people well look really bad. And heaven forbid you have an opinion different than theirs (also apparently false information). And they won’t even allow me to hide or get rid of the crap they are trying to force down my throat. You can forget that ‘see less things like this’ button cause it’s bull. They just keep doing it. Parler has become the better place to be.


Not to mention the lack of helpfulness if they have any kind of technical issue. I have posted or see a family member post something I’m tagged in that says that it’s not available cause it’s been deleted when that is also crap. I mean come on man. Fix it and shut up.


On it because of family and friends. Not a fan anymore. Probably gonna track me down and shut everything off because I said something they didn’t like. But wouldn’t that just be par for their gold plated, liberal biased, greed filled, power hungry course.

Censorship at its Finest
Facebook is the Thought Police and try their best to manipulate their consumers.
They also read posts that are marked “Only Me”.
I did an experiment with “Only Me” setting across newsfeed. Post that are for my eyes only and those would get “fact checked” There is NO customer service to discuss any reasons as to why an account would be disabled. Artificial Intelligence robots are in charge. After 10 years of using the platform and posting “only me” post for my viewing Facebook disabled my account along with business pages that are now inaccessible. I created a profile frame in Alpril 2020 , hashtag “great awakening” and this statement was flagged as “racist, hate speech and bullying” i. October 2020. With no warning, my account was disabled. This platform is a BIG THREAT To constitutional free speech. It’s a platform built to distract from life and become addicted to Social engineering as they collect data on you.
Watch the “social dilemma” on Netflix, and hear straight from those who have held prominent position within the company how “targeted” the consumer of the platform is. FACEBOOK is a FASCISTS Platform who assault their own users without warning. They own Instagram (which my account was deleted doe being connected to Facebook). Beware! You ARE THE PRODUCT!

Unfair treatment specifically towards conservatives
As a social media outlet that is against free speech, I find if appalling and offensive that you go after one group of people (conservatives) but you will let the other group (democrats) get out of line and routinely go unchecked. People should be free to say what they think. The only time a post should he removed is if there is a direct threat to another person or if there is a post that suggests harm to another individual. Take notice there is a huge difference between showing a meme about a cop being slaughtered with a knife (yes FB allowed it) and posts talking about a historical event where people were murdered, such as the holocaust or Ottoman Empire. FB deploys so called Fact checkers who wouldn’t know the facts if it hit them over the head. Those Fact checkers have the nerve to go into your private page! They shamefully try to steal public opinion. I find this very disturbing that fact checkers can get into people’s private accounts. If you are looking for a safe social media platform where you can say what you think without being harassed, this isn’t it. There are some amazing new platforms out there that protect free speech. Do yourself a favor if you care about your privacy and your rights and go elsewhere.

Facebook I’m reviewing your App Store, as a result, of 1-star rating because my account was wrongly accused of ” My Post goes against our Community Standards on nudity or sexual activity ” over a gift feed I shared to my feed of a couple just (kissing ) was a result of my account being ”temporarily” banned/kicks me out of my account without any warning from Facebook U.I settings itself telling me it goes against their actions. Which is completely ridiculous/B.S I'm not the only one who goes through this process more than thousands of users is getting this same effect trying to reach out to you from Twitter even your Headquarters calling ya did nothing about it. I even try using Facebook again on my safari showing me I have an option to remove this issue out of my Facebook feed which leads to another error it couldn't be discarded. Also, Your Previous updates have Facebook and Instagram connection into one not only I'm kicked out of FB so as my Instagram account Instagram replied ” Thanks For Providing Your Info” ” We” ll review your info and if we can confirm it, but you'll also be able to request a review in the Help Center within approximately (24 HOURS) I didn't receive anything Please fix your app.

Censorship and action block
So my original Facebook account was deleted because I was an admin for “save the children USA” things were going great until one day my Facebook and the 6 other admins accounts were all deleted within an hour on the same day. Then the next day our Instagram accounts that were connected to those Facebook accounts were deactivated as well. Now I have a new Facebook account and I have been on an action block for 8 days. I can’t like, comment, share OR respond to messages at all. I have reached out to Facebook many times nothing I do to “fix” it is working and they refuse to tell me how long this block is going to last. Mind you this new account is with a completely different email. Facebook is silencing people for no good reason. That is why on the 13th at 6am me and a million people are leaving at the same time. There was a group (on Facebook) that was started to get the word out and tons of people are leaving because of the censorship. I recommend parler, gab and clapper! All great socials you use and they aren’t biased and their creators aren’t child predators. Long story short don’t use Facebook unless you’re a Democrat who doesn’t mind being silenced by the media ??

Shutting down
I don't know why but lately Facebook app has been shutting down and going to my main screen while I'm reading something??very annoying!!! Fix this bug please! It also refreshes on its own. That's really annoying too when you are going through comments and then back out wanting to continue where you were before going to the comments and it decides on its own "nope you were done scrolling" ??
Nothing has been fixed. It still does all of the above even tho there's been tons of updates. Seriously fix this issue it's annoying! Stars went down bc it still hasn't been fixed


STILL REFRESHES ON ITS OWN! When will this be fixed??? In the middle of reading something in Facebook and go to my internet for a second and then back to Facebook and it decides I was done and refreshes and sends me back to the top! Very annoying and j lose posts I was in the middle of reading. Why won’t you fix this issue. Many people have the same issue yet you don’t fix it!! Stars went down yet again bc it’s not fixed. One 1 star to go and honestly if I could give it a 0 star I would! Fix the freaking problem already!!!

So Done!, 10/24/2018
Someone LIED to you
Whomever told you this latest update was a great idea, SHOULD BE FIRED. 1)When notifications come in that I’ve been tagged or someone has replied to a comment I made, it no longer takes you to the post, just to the comment. So if I commented last week and I get a reply today I have absolutely no idea what the original post was about. 2) A notification disappears after I look at it. So if I have to refer back to it for any reason, I have to somehow find the page of the original poster and then hunt for the post. STUPID IDEA 3) When going to some notifications, when you click on it it takes you to a blank post. I see the persons name, the time they posted and maybe if someone reacted to it, but absolutely no post at all. There’s even comments on it but I see no post at all. Yes I have access to their page, I haven’t been blocked and they call me to say “did you see my last post” and all I see is nothing.
3) Auto refresh is annoying. Someone posts an article and I take 2-3 minutes reading it and when I go to comment on it, you’ve refreshed my feed. Thanks for nothing.
I’m sick of y’all. If I didn’t need this app to keep in contact with family around the globe, I’d delete it.

No notifications about my posts!
For the last 2 months, the notification settings in the app are a complete mess. The app will have the red number, but one of them are about my own posts. Any reactions or comments to MY posts don’t load in the list of notifications, so I have no idea about comments or reactions unless I actually go to the post itself. All I see are notifications about my friends’ posts. Further, while the news feed works fine, the list of notifications is limited to EXACTLY 20 notifications. When I scroll to the bottom, the page just jumps and doesn’t refresh to show any more than exactly 20. Maybe once a week I will scroll and be surprised to be able to scroll past 20, but it’s not because of anything I did or didn’t do. AND once I scroll back to the top of the list and scroll back down, I’m limited to 20 again. AND notifications for my posts still aren’t in the list. I have a brand new iPhone 6s Plus (3 months), so if Facebook doesn’t fix it soon, I am going to be convinced that the problems are a way to push people to upgrade their phones to the newest versions.

If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it
Nobody wants a game page or a group page. It’s amazing how many different ways you want to send me push notifications, that I literally only click on so that it will go away. I went in to change my notification settings and it turns out you will not let me turn off all group notifications at once and I have to go through a list and manually select out of 100 groups which ones I want, the slider for all is greyed out. This is totally unnecessary, and nobody asked for this. Why do I have a notification for every time someone goes live? Anytime an event is added at a venue I checked into ONE TIME that’s across the world in a different country? Facebook notifications used to notify me when someone wanted to talk to me, and I’ve done my best to continually update my setting but it’s getting crazy. Now I’ll have 7 notifications and check it and not a single one is about a friend I have that was reaching out to me. Events, game page, so and so went live, so and so checked in safe, I have memories from 10 years ago to look at, so and so posted in this group, like I do. Not. Care. And I don’t need a red push notification making it seem like I should.

Censorship
This social media page is a communist propaganda platform. They have a baseline of ideas in the political arena that if you differ from they will not only censor your post they’ll actually suspend you from access to your account.


Facebook doesn’t agree with the premise that we are all individuals with different views, opinions, goals and ideologies. However those are not welcome on facebook. You are made to conform to alt left ideology or you will be throttled down, you will be reigned in on who sees your post and uploads. And if you have a business that advertises on Facebook they will use monetary displine actions against you. It can be detrimental to a small business as many of the Ideas, morals and values in a small community vary exateemely difeeently from those on the coastal big metro areas: but big tech such as Facebook doesn’t care about you or your business. It only matters that you CONFORM TO THEIR IDEOLOGY.


This is NOT a platform in which I suggest you involve your business or family with. Security and safety is also a huge concern for me and my company and the privacy of my customers. Mewe is a much better platform for what we the American people are trying to do in this country. And Parler is far better than Twitter

#ReplaceFacebook
If I could give zero stars then I would. They banned me and then didn’t tell me they muted me which is just a very disgusting way to act. Just by that alone proves how corrupted they are. There’s absolutely no reason for my post not to be post because I have checked all the possibilities and I have 5G and a nice phone so there’s no reason for my post to be blocked besides the fact that they banned me and threw away the key and didn’t even tell me that they muted me. I also had an FIVE STAR online marketplace and convenient store but Facebook fully banned me from making an honest living. I made sure to give the best customer support and I even gave refunds. I was 100% willing to comply and change my posts but they banned me still! They do not deserve the business of Americans! They don’t have the right to take the Authority of Government in their own hands! I will not support a Social network that silences free speech and kicks out innocent users! There’s only one reason they should ever have the right to do this and it’s if American laws are broken! I wronged no one, I scammed no one and I stole from no one! I also never hacked anyone! But I’m banned! I’d give zero stars if I could. #ReplaceFacebook #destroyfacebook

They have taken the freedom away!
So much has changed about fb when I first downloaded the app I absolutely loved how you can stay connected with family and friends but somehow the very core of that has gone missing. Now you have to pay to be seen ! On both Instagram and fb !! I see the same 7 ppl on my timeline but some how I have 5000 active friends. I can post daily and won’t be seen how can a small business even be seen without the burden of coming out of pocket just to still not be seen unless you come out of pocket daily! As an African American I definitely feel RED LINE when using this app ! And I definitely don’t feel like it’s equal opportunity on all the major social media especially this one . When we try to “ pull ourselves up by the boot straps “ we are constantly systematically STOPPED speaking from my own experience! and I’m rarely one to speak on things like this but however it did prompt me to leave a review. Hopefully things can change for the better. To think an app that was supposed to connect us with family and friends are doing everything in their power to stop us from connecting

Why are you continually making it harder to sync my events to my iCalendar?!?!
Seriously!?!? I want my whole schedule in ONE place, home, work, fun, and that’s not going to be the Facebook events tab, so if you think I’m going to keep using that to setup, find or advocate for using events, you better go back to making it easier to sync with the iFamily of computing. It used to just automatically sync everything from FB to iCal, no problem. Then about 8-9 months ago, that stopped, and I had to either manually sync events one by one from my phone, or go to a web version of FB, find my calendar, and manually tell it to sync all. And even that doesn’t update any events, which is a pita. ?? My main device is an iPad. Do you understand the PITA it is to convince safari to fun a web based version of a site?


Now you’ve gone and “improved” your surfing experience, AND I CAN NO LONGER FIND THE OPTION TO SYNC MY CALENDAR AT ALL. I have already started using other programs to schedule events for my activities that are more user friendly to all OS’s. And I will be recommending to others to do the same. You really need to not make people intertwining FB into their lives in ways they want it harder.

App won’t open on iPad Mini 2 running iOS 12
The Facebook app shows that it was updated today, and now it will not open on my iPad Mini 2, which cannot run iOS 13. It worked fine yesterday. Please remember many people are using older devices - which really aren’t that old; I’ve only had this iPad for 3 years - and make sure your app works with the previous version of iOS as well as the current one. UPDATE: After reading other reviews, the app evidently doesn’t work on the newest iOS 13, either. This app needs to be fixed ASAP! If you can’t fix the bug by tomorrow, please roll us back to the previous version! UPDATE 2: My phone has now installed the new version of the app and it still opens, so evidently only certain devices are affected. This is still a big problem and needs an emergency fix! UPDATE 3: I followed the advice of another reviewer and deleted the app and reinstalled it; that fixed the problem and it’s working again. Evidently the data was overloaded. Why does this app store so much data? There’s no need to accumulate data on my devices except to save the login cookies and maybe a few login cookies and form info for the built-in browser.

Censorship and Wall Street own Facebook now!!!
I have been a Facebook user for many years, as the saying goes I was with Facebook before Facebook was cool...When the kids were using my space I introduce them to the Facebook platform and I have to say I am disgusted with the direction that Mark zetterberg has decided to take Facebook. Wall Street owns Facebook which is why you have seen more and more advertisers bombard your social media threads but what makes it worse is that none of those advertisers are even vetted. They are allowed to flood the platform because the almighty dollar pays for them to flood the platform. I have never been scammed by so many advertisers as I have been on Facebook and the political divide that Facebook encourages is beyond belief and for that reason I am giving Facebook a zero out of 10 on a review and have ceased using the platform. I’ve decided to hit them where it will hurt the most and that is with Wall Street!!! They count numbers and when those numbers drop it affects the market and that’s where Facebook is going to take the biggest hit is by their members dropping Facebook!!! Hit them in the pocketbook, everything hurts more when it cost money!!!

Enough with refreshing the newsfeed!
I never write reviews, but these recent updates make me want to delete Facebook. 6 months ago, if I needed to pause my Facebook scrolling go do something else, I would just click someone’s picture and it would “hold my place” in my newsfeed. This was great. I’m a mom to a toddler and I oftentimes have to multitask. NOW, if I switch to a different app or put my phone down for 10 SECONDS to do something else, my newsfeed refreshes, and starts at the top. This is infuriating when I’m in the middle of reading an article or looking at an album of pictures. What is the purpose of this? Who is it benefitting? Certainly not your users. I find myself getting on Facebook less and less these past few weeks because I get more annoyance than enjoyment out of it. Do you not do any kind of market research before you implement these things? And please, get rid of the camera. Everyone and their brother has a camera on their phone. I think we’re set! I’m tired of swiping left to exit a post and accidentally hitting the camera which takes 10 seconds to load. I can’t imagine what your UI/QA teams get paid to “ok” these poorly planned “enhancements”.

Unwanted sounds. Huge unusable app.
I kept hoping Facebook would stop switching in app sounds back on and that they would also do away with trying to force me to create a passcode, but the undoing of my preferences by the app has become relentless. I have to switch off the app sounds daily. It’s obnoxious! I never wanted them in the first place. How many times will I have to inform the app that I want the sounds shut off for good? It is unpleasant to hear cheesy clicking and clacking sounds as you simply move from post to post on Facebook. Horrible idea.


It’s not only that. This is the largest most bloated battery sucking app there is. It bogs down my phone. What others have said about the updates consuming all of their storage is absolutely true. I wasn’t going to write a negative review even for the constant unnecessary toggling on of the app sounds, but every time there’s an update for this app there is no room for it on my phone. I have almost nothing on my phone. How is this app mobile friendly in any way? It’s a behemoth. I’m going to collect my personal photos and documents from it and delete it. I’ll happily find other places to socialize on the Internet. Sorry.

Seriously?
Okay so well I love the app. I get to talk to my family and join groups specifically the ones about animals and anime’s I like/have.


But there’s just one thing that makes me mad. You guys took away my market place, I’ve contacted help and support so many times about it. I’ve gone to that stupid webpage that tells you steps and none of that stuff is even on my page like to request a review.


I did nothing wrong. I sold antique dolls my mom got when she was younger, I sold a model helicopter and a skateboard. That’s it. That’s all I was selling. And I was completely transparent in telling people the damages they had and pricing them reasonably. So I know I didn’t break any of your rules. I saw that it could be cause I was inactive. Sense I have become a lot more active. I’m on everyday, I update my profile picture all the time, I joined groups and I’m always talking in those. I even like and comment of some of my friends and families post so I know that being inactive isn’t the problem anymore. I also know that marketplace is in fact active where I live cause I’m in Texas! ALSO the entire icon is gone and hasn’t returned.

It gets worse with each update!!!!
When I updated last time, the orders of how the comments or messages show up are all weird. It shows up as “most relevant” first and in no particular order. And even when I change to “newest first”, it still shows the “most relevant” first. I cannot rearrange the messages to show up in order of oldest to newest or vice versa. Please fix this!


I updated the app hoping this will help the problem above. But with this new update, not only the problem above persist, I now have a new problem. When uploading pictures, I can no longer have the option to look up my pictures in the albums/folders I created. I can only look through the camera rolls, where things are in no particular order. I belong to buy and sell groups and sell things on Facebook. So I created these albums/folders to increase efficiency when looking for items to post to save my sanity and not have to look through thousands of pictures in the camera rolls. Now there is no options to go to the albums/folders. Please fix this ASAP or your app will becomes useless soon. Please help us becomes more efficient, not less. So frustrated!!!

Biased and doesn’t allow human Rights organizations to speak up
One star and I’m being generous !!!!!
Face book is an application that purposefully removes any press reports of news or of human rights organizations that speak on behalf oppressed Palestinians in the occupied Palestine by the illegal armed settlers of whom attack and threaten the safety of the indigenous Palestinians, stealing their homes and lands by putting hand on, terrorizing families to forcefully flea their lands and homes. The so called Israeli Army ( mob) demolishes people’s homes and destroys agricultural land to terrorize the Palestinians and place hardships on their survival.. people ( including children of age 5 years can be placed in prison without a fair trial and in many cases with no reason, to pressure families to give up their rights and ownership. Crimes of war take place in the occupied territories on daily basis, but still biased Face book shushes the voices of freedom to express their support and call for justice on its platform. Not only that, they suspend accounts if they express or even broadcast what’s happening behind doors.
I expect that from a plat form that’s owned by a guy that gave up his American nationality /citizenship to get away from paying American money taxes, for the millions of dollars he made!!!!

I do not recommend
I have had an account with Facebook for at least 13 years. These last 4 years I have noticed that Facebook has increasingly become biased and started silencing people’s opinions that differ from facebooks own agenda. If you like to be treated like a child that is incapable of making their own choices, then this is the app for you. This is the app of Censorship, “fact-checking” your personal opinions, account suspension if you think differently than them, and threats of deleting your account.
The year of 2020 has been stressful enough without having my social media shoving their personal agenda down my throat. If you don’t have Facebook yet and are considering it, I highly recommend that you watch the documentary “the social dilemma” on Netflix first, before making your decision. When this type of social media has caused the increase of suicide in kids 10-14 by 150%, there is something seriously wrong!
Facebook took what could have been a great venue to connect people all across the world, and turned it into nothing more than a political circus used to push biased political information and further divide us.
If I could give them a 0, I would!!!

Little details make a big difference
Here recently videos have started displaying this keep watching button right in the middle of the video. If I’m just scrolling through my newsfeed and want to watch a video in it’s entirety then I should be able to do that!! Not only that but then I also have to deal with the ads in the video too! It’s frustrating and makes the app not very enjoyable to use! Also, the back/forward arrows on a webpage need to be put back where they were at the bottom of the page. It’s too easy now to hit the X button to close a webpage when all I really wanted to do was go back a page. Very frustrating when you’ve been looking at something for a long time only for it to close and then the newsfeed refreshes and you’ve lost the link you were looking at originally. None of the other apps (Pinterest, Instagram) do this. Their back/forward buttons are at the bottom of the screen, away from the “X” button so you don’t risk closing your page. It’s little thing like this that make or break an app. And right now Facebook, you’re on the verge of falling apart.

Use Facebook if you wanted censored!!
If I could give a negative stars I would!! ?? If you don’t think say or do what Facebook wants they will censor your posts so people don’t see them. You mentioned democrats, Biden or Harris you are automatically censored and a fact-checking pops up saying that your post isn’t true. Even though in your post you provide facts, the will even put you in Facebook jail from 24 hours up to 30 days or your Facebook account being completely closed!! Thought this was American!! What happened to freedom of speech? Conservatives are the only ones being censored. The left can say the most horrible disgusting things and Facebook will say it doesn’t go against community standards. But if I was to type the same exact thing but put Biden instead of Trump my account would be put in jail!! Facebook you are turning into a cesspool!! You don’t do anything to the disgusting accounts promoting children sex trafficking! Don’t see them being closed down for violating community standards... why because are you getting a kickback from it? ?????? you cleared the #saveourchildren as soon as you thought Biden was gonna win!! You are disgusting supporting a p€do!!

Not What You Were Looking For
They flagged my account and threatened to suspend me stating I was a “dangerous individual or group” for posting a meme of Biden as the Quaker Oats guy and it says “Faker Votes”. If that’s not a violation of simple fun being poked then it’s an outright gag-rag stuffed down my throat for exposing REAL WORLD criminal acts of deception towards and entire nation. Bye Facebook, don’t worry about trying to come back from THIS. It’s your pink-slip, walking papers, eviction notice. Your bankruptcy will be closely following after what you have done to your user base. Siding with traitors and treasonous cheating commies!


Facebook is pretty much done and over with. I don’t even know how they ever beat out MySpace. At least that site wasn’t a total useless piece of trash like Facebook has ALWAYS been.
Now they’re censoring everything their users do, post and say. I don’t know about you, but for me, that’s not social media. It’s socialist media and that’s all this app links to.
There are much better options available now and I wouldn’t even waste my time giving these jerks your personal details and information. They hold onto it like Gold to sell later on the black market. Like MySpace did when THEY went bankrupt.

Facebook Messenger
Please find a way not to show all your friends when you’re on FB. I sometimes like to zone out on FB just to pass the night. It is very very annoying to receive pop-ups in the wee small hours of the night from people (most often men) whom I barely know. There are no boundaries on Messenger. What I mean by this is that anyone can Message or even call anyone else whether they are friends or not. I have been harassed and annoyed in this manner also by a man who was drunk and didn’t want to take no for an answer in the middle of the night, calling on Messenger over and over again. I had to threaten to call police. How did he know I was awake and alone? Messenger! It can also bring up trust issues with people in relationships who don’t know if their significant other is live chatting with a side piece or playing FarmVille in the wee small hours of the night. I’m a private person who likes to keep my business to myself. Find a way, please, to let the user decide whether or not they want to let anyone or no one pop up and interrupt their lives with Messenger. I regularly install and then uninstall, when it could just be so easy to fix it. Please do.

Keyboard support, less hostile video playback
Hi there! So I’m addicted to the FaceFeed as anyone else, and I’ve a couple of suggestions for the iOS/iPadOS app. Currently using FaceBook in the Safari browser is better for me because of keyboard support. It seems crazy to me that there isn’t at least support for scrolling through the feed with arrow keys on Bluetooth or otherwise connected keyboards. Commands for search and home and refresh, etcetera, would be nice too- but man, the scrolling thing kills me. Also, I doubt I’ll see a change here as the way videos are currently presented seems designed to keep people watching them, but it feels awfully user-hostile to have to figure out different swipe patterns and do it quickly to dismiss a video before another one plays. Also, the relegating of Airplay options to that sub-menu alongside Chromecast options basically broke proper Airplay support. It never seems to want to stream to my AppleTV properly now, always have to give up and go with the less than ideal screen mirroring system-wide option. Cheers.

This is more about a hacking group
I would really appreciate it if you could put hacking as one of the things your not allowed to do on Facebook because I reported these two groups who hack peoples groups and accounts for money and there was no hacking thing for me to report them for (it would be awesome if you could make it so we can give a personal report) so I reported them for doing sales that weren’t allowed and in the message back they just completely ignored the fact that the group was hacking, like what the heck?!?!? I mean no hate this is one of the best apps I own but those hacker groups might mess things up a bit one of the groups I’m in is doing some shutting down stuff as well as not letting new members join because of the hackers! It would be great if you could do something about it!! The group name is “black hat hackers” and actually when you look that up you find a few more hacking groups too please do something about it this really is not good thank you if you do!

Latest update hurts my heart
In the latest update, the app no longer has the “share” button when you try to share a post to a group. You must individually look up and share each group, which is cumbersome and takes far more steps/time. My child is a brand Rep, and it used to be so convenient to make our promotion post and share in 5-10 groups with a few quick taps. Now, I have to individually share the post to each individual group. I understand it is probably some kind of safety feature to prevent hackers and bots and bugs, but it has really made it more difficult for us.


Also, the new layout on the computer (not the app, but the physical website) has me all sorts of lost and confused. I’m a pretty tech-y person, but when you move everything from its relative location, it makes it much more difficult of an interface to use.


Love the new avatars though!!! They are super fun and cute!!! Also, the new and updates privacy settings on groups are lovely!

Not worth it, borderline violates freedom of speech
They’re run almost completely by bots it seems and you can be banned from posting for the most ridiculous things. Wasn’t like this before, but either they’re under new management or their bots are now hypersensitive. I didn’t even get told what I did wrong, only that I posted something offensive in one of the many groups I’m in (I’m in a group for people to share offensive opinions, so yeah I’m going to post something there that may be construed that way because that is what that group is for!) and that I’m blocked from posting until April 1. April 1 came and I tested it out, still blocked until 8:22 the morning they said. It’s 8:58 now and I’m still blocked, but no explanation this time. I’ve had posts taken down before that don’t break any laws or advocate breaking any laws, but are simply funny memes that I share to specific groups so I don’t offend anyone who is outside of that group and not wanting to see it. Even been banned just for posting my opinions, no threats, no attacking people, just operating my right to freedom of speech! They shouldn’t call themselves a public platform if they can’t uphold the rights of the public.

Learn How to "Keep it Sold"
Updated review Nov 2019. Stop messing up the app. Fix the bugs, but stop tweaking it. Once again, when I go to Groups, I know longer see the Groups I belong to. This feature has gone away before; I reported it and it was restored. Now, after the latest update it’s gone again.


A basic business adage is to "keep it sold" which means taking care of your current customers while you also develop new ones. You've already got millions of us sold on Facebook, so quit screwing around with the app and just give us a stable, reliable feed. Let the users decide what they see in their wall and in what order. I understand you make money from ads, so go ahead and put them out there, but let us manage our own content and interaction with our own friends, groups and pages. The more your developers keep tweaking with the app, the less appealing it becomes and the more unstable. Now it keeps freezing and quitting, making it difficult to post. Do you even ask your users what kind of changes they want before messing with the app & your stupid algorithms?

Conservative Censorship
I am so angry about the way conservative content is censored. I am also incensed that FB has decided who won the presidential election in 2020 when it is no where near being certified and is rife with obvious fraud and illegal manipulation perpetrated by marxists/leftists bent on taking control of and converting our country to socialism. Also the presidential tally is displayed incorrectly in order to influence the public at large to accept Joe Biden as our president. There is no such title as president elect. This country is a republic and not a dictatorship and I refuse to be influenced by FB. I have my own mind and can think for myself and am free to do so under the Constitution. I am angry that FB censors Christian content as well but it’s ok to condone trafficking of humans, hate speech from the left, and Muslim beliefs and many other notions that I find repugnant and promote hate and Marxist ideals. Zuckerburg has sold his soul for power and money. He should go to prison for trying to facilitate the conversion of our country to socialism. He has abused his power and he should be brought to justice accordingly. It is not his place to dictate the direction of this nation just because he has money and power. We the people decide.

Facebook consistently dissapoints
When I first joined Facebook way back in its earlier days, I enjoyed connecting with and communicating with family and friends, playing games, sharing photos and joining some special interest groups. After awhile I found it to be a bit too invasive and left. Years later I rejoined again for family reasons. I began to use it for national and international news and political interest as well. Over the years, and especially during this election year, Facebook became increasingly biased against conservative views. The “fact checkers,” engineers and executives seem to work overtime to censor important conservative news and information, to stifle free speech and exchange of information and discourse, and to often shut down members who do not tow some of the leftist political lines, talking points and agendas. I now feel like it is becoming a literal arm of the globalist/socialist/leftist juggernaut which is intent on introducing a controlling groupthink mentality on the world. What was once an entertaining and educational forum has become very partisan, very controlling and even divisive. I’ve stayed mainly because of special interest groups in arts, health/medicine and many other.

Biased,discriminating,harassment
Now that there are other options,and Facebook no longer has a monopoly on social media outlets,I highly suggest not going with Facebook. If you do not agree with a highly liberal agenda being force fed down your throat,then don’t load this app. Facebook bombards you with their agenda on every post,and if you dare to disagree,then prepare for the Facebook Gestapo to ban your account at anytime they wish. Facebook is NOT designed for anyone that is not a complete left wing lunatic,and God forbid you actually disagree with anything they shove in your face. Facebook is NOT a safe place for conservative people. They will NOT protect you,or punish anyone that goes after you. You can be receiving death threats and they will not act,but if you voice a semi-conservative opinion,then they will pounce on you before your finger lifts off of the “send” button. Facebook hides behind their legal loopholes,and they will soon be answering for their biased discrimination. They harvest your info,they allow others to do the same,and forget about deleting your account. They make it almost impossible to delete. They will never give you a straight answer on anything.

I really hate Facebook right now
I can’t remember when I liked Facebook in a LONG TIME! When they decided to to play Judge and jury over what games we were playing ( which included many many Facebook people who wanted to take over Facebook with selfish selfies and Hey Look at me so called bible authorities which included nothing nothing I ever read in the Bible??? Why? Bc it was new age Christian or whatever that wiped all their sins away and still let them let them cast stone’s at others with sin to people who they didn’t like anymore! Hypocrite Bible studies and Fake selfies pushed all of the fun and and entertaining that people used to enjoy! Plus I cannot see all of my friends that I follow or all of my favorite entertainment that I like and follow! I get 2 or 3 friends that I follow and 1 entertainment ( Steve Harvey) to be exact that I follow! I can’t even share my children’s pictures bc they say it’s in my settings! I follow Facebook instructions and it NEVER works! Nothing in my Facebook settings ever works and I do have the Facebook app also ! I recently just stopped using Facebook at all bc of all of the troubles I have had and now I can rest more easily! Thanks Fakebook !

Nothing loads anymore...
When I open the app I can only see a handful of posts from days ago. When I scroll to the bottom, the app doesn’t load any more posts. Refreshing does nothing. I don’t get any error messages. On the posts that do show up: 1. comments don’t load at all 2. videos freeze after max 10-15 seconds 3. when I react to or comment on something it never actually posts it; next time I load the app and see the post I commented on, my both my comment & reaction don’t show up.
Today it got to the point that when I opened the app, it just says “network error, tap to retry” and of course tapping “retry” does nothing.
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app multiple times. The first time seemed to fix it but the next day it was acting up again. The second time it started acting up within a few hours. This time it went from “tap to retry” to just acting buggy. The app keeps degrading to the point where I literally cannot use it on my phone which is my main source of using Facebook; I rarely if ever go on Facebook on the computer. This needs to be fixed so I can actually use your product.
