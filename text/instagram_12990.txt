Help!!!
I appreciate the quick responses and corrections for the issues I’ve had. Thank you. I’m very new to the business side of Insta, so I’m not very fluent in the algorithms and how they work. I don’t quite understand how to obtain followers. I don’t like that my profile seems to be categorized with other dog stores which is pointless, because other stores aren’t potential customers. My profile keeps getting tagged with inappropriate pictures, since my profile is linked to the website they upload there too. I’ve changed my settings to prevent that now but somehow they are still there in the background as if they are used to place my profile into a spam server or something, idk. It seems like posts don’t circulate unless you pay, especially on Facebook. Plus paying only gets you false likes, the analytics show down to the millisecond how much time was spent on the site, what page, what products etc. I feel like the clicks are computer generated and aren’t real potential customers. My profile lost 100 followers overnight it seems and now for every follower I get I lose the same number. Although I appreciate the followers I do have, it seems they are from countries in which I don’t sell products, so again pointless. How do I generate followers? How do I prevent the inappropriate tagging? How do I keep my profile from being spammed? What am I missing?

This new update is terrible
Instagram has made it even harder for you to see posts from the people that you actually follow with this most recent update. I now only see about 10 - 12 photos from people I actually follow, before I get to the “you’ve been caught up” message & suggested posts start popping up. I follow 200+ people, 80% of whom update regularly, yet instagram is making it impossible to see them. I miss so much time sensitive information, including sales, events or donations, all because instagram has moved explore page posts to your home feed as well. And posts are being BURIED with this new update. Half the time the “new” posts on my timeline are 1-2 weeks old & the posts in my “older” tab are from the same day. As a creator myself, my engagement has dropped exponentially, as Instagram is making it increasingly difficult for my work, & the work of others, to be seen.


And that’s not to mention the horrific placement of the new reels tab, dead in the center of the app, with the new shop page directly right, kicking both the post button & the notifications tab to the top of the screen on the home page. As a small business, this is FRUSTRATING to say the least. It seems like instagram is hell bent on punishing the very people that keep their app alive. At the very least, give people the autonomy to organize their app tabs the way they want to & choose to have a chronological home feed or an algorithmic based one. Come on Instagram, lets do better.

Hard To Navigate with the New Layout
first off i’d like to say that i’ve been using instagram since 2015. i’ve seen some changes over the course of these past few years that were very good for the overall use of the app, and some that just made navigating the app more difficult. the main reason why instagram has become so popular over the years was it’s simple layout that made it easy to access and interact with followers and discover people. but now, in 2020, likes and view counts are hidden, the feed isn’t in chronological order, the algorithm only allows you to see posts of only a handful of people you follow, and now the notifications have moved. if instagram wants to keep its users satisfied, then they need to go back to the classic look. keeping the classic layout with home, explore page, upload, notifications, and profile at the bottom makes the app easier to navigate. there is no reason why the shopping bag needs to be on the bottom bar because not everyone shops from instagram. there are a lot of scammers on the app! instead of changing the layout, instagram needs to fix the algorithm, put posts on the timeline back in chronological order, get rid of bot and spam accounts, and remove accounts/posts that don’t follow the community guidelines. now more than ever, there are many accounts that spread hate and misinformation! why was changing the layout a priority? fix it and bring likes and view counts back!

Annoying issue
Instagram is a great app to use on your free time and to connect with other people. This is why I was really interested in using Instagram to try and help out my barber career. The one annoying issue I’m having is when it comes to trying to add an action button for booking. I have tried this with three different booking apps so far and with no luck. For example I am trying to add my square appointments app as a book option on my business account. The videos I have seen about how to do this, show that once you click on the app you use to schedule your clients, you need to enter in the URL that will link them to your booking page. I believe this is where the problem is. Instagram doesn’t give me an option to enter a URL. The order that Instagram sends me is ( connect website > please select business to connect > connect to Instagram > connection successful). Then when I refresh my page there is no action button. I have used three different booking apps in hopes that one of them would work and none of them do. I have the online booking option turned on within the app as well and it still doesn’t work. It’s extremely frustrating and to add onto it, I can’t find anywhere online to help me. There’s no way to contact Instagram, at least from what I have seen and it feels like it’s never going to work for me. This app could easily be a 5 star, but this one problem is really making it hard.

Please Stop With The Horrible Updates
I've been using Instagram since 2013 and every update I've gotten since then has been disappointing. This newest update (version 166.1) is one of the most annoying and ugliest looking updates yet. First of all, why would I want to connect Facebook messenger to my Instagram account?? It's so unnecessary and of course the DM feature on Instagram is basically mutating into Facebook messenger with the message reactions and the different colored messages. Secondly, the shopping feature being on the bottom bar is the absolute worst. I've never shopped on Instagram and never will but I'm stuck with this completely useless button on my toolbar and I always accidentally hit it when I just want to take a peak at the explore page. Thirdly, the reels feature is absolutely awful (I know that was from a previous update) and I hate that I have the reels icon on my toolbar. The toolbar in general is getting way too confusing and too many things are getting added to it. The fact that I can't even post a photo from my toolbar is probably the most annoying feature. I love Instagram and every time I get an update I just say to myself "Well, I guess I'll give it a try" but all of these updates that have happened in the last 1-2 years have pushed me over the edge. Probably going to delete the app because these updates have been nothing but awful ever since Facebook took over. Hate what they've done with it. Stop trying to turn Instagram into Facebook.

Inaccessible. Many problems.
I’ve got a couple Instagram accounts, and no two have the same features as the other. It’s incredibly confusing and annoying to switch between two accounts on the same app that don’t even have the same features. One might have a different, newer version of DM’s while another has been stuck with an old version and has never been updated.
For the past two months my main account has been action blocked almost every other week. Instagram has made me change my password 8 times within then as well. I rely on posting often to keep my audience and gain new followers (as well as to catch the eyes of potential customers, as I am an artist that makes money off of commissions) and I obviously can’t do this when Instagram blocks me from posting. I don’t share my account with anyone, I’ve never purchased followers, and I’ve never used any third party apps with Instagram. So it’s beyond me why they keep doing this.
Not to mention, the support is awful. If you have an issue or if you need help with something, you might as well forget it. The support team is incredibly unhelpful and has always been this way. I’ve seen accounts post highly illegal content that Instagram deems as safe for all ages! Even after reporting. Any legitimate problems I’ve tried to report have been met with silence.
The idea of Instagram is great. But the app itself is becoming worse and worse as time goes on.

Good app with too many flaws
Instagram is perhaps the application I use the most, and I really enjoy it when it’s at its best. However, the flaws are simply overwhelming at times. I’m writing this review because my account has been wrongfully shadow-banned and action blocked over 6 times now without an actual just cause for it. Every time, it says I was allegedly “sharing my account with a service that helps me get more likes and followers” even though that’s blatantly untrue. I have 0 posts, 0 likes and well under 1000 followers. I have written 4 detailed reports explaining my situation but it has been to no avail. Every time this happens, I’m forced to change my password, I’m logged out of my account and then I’m action blocked for an entire week. Every time I try to like or comment, it gives me the option to report it if I believe they have made a mistake but nothing works. My account is never checked, my week long action blocks are never reduced or lifted, my reports are never acknowledged and I’m always getting wronged. I also really dislike the fact that I cannot easily contact anyone from Instagram to help me with issues like these, I can only leave long, written reports for you to ignore and do nothing about. Please revise your algorithms and consider having a Tech Support line with human responders for unique and recurring problems like this one.

You’re killing me, here
I like Instagram. I do. It’s a good app for keeping in contact with friends and for being able to share the things I create as an artist. But I swear the app gets worse with every update. The changes to the layout of the home page that make it so it’s basically a second explore page and so you don’t see posts from those you follow in chronological order are frustrating. The change to messages that make it so swiping prompts a reply to someone rather than exiting is confusing and non-intuitive, not to mention outright useless. The changes to the placement of the notification and posting tabs are infuriating. This is an app for sharing, not for shopping. Keep the shopping tab out of the main tab bar and put reels back with explore.


Instagram would be much more user friendly if there was an option to toggle certain features (although calling them features instead of “hinderances” might, in some cases, be generous), such as the swipe-to-reply in messages, the suggested posts after the most recent posts in the home section, or whether posts were ordered algorithmically or chronologically. Additionally, allowing users to set up the layout of their tab bar would also make it more user friendly. I’m sure someone out there prefers the easy access to the reels tab, and would want to keep it where it currently is. But most don’t. Thus, allowing users to choose which features show up on the bar would make the app far better.

All we want is chronological order!
I love this app so much. I use it every single day, and use it to keep in contact with my friends. It is very easy to post things, direct messages work well, and stories are a neat feature even if it wasn’t an original idea.
Although there are many impressive features on this app, I am not sure if I like the new comment section where you can see the top liked comments first and not the most recent ones. I feel like I miss out on everything that Instagram doesn’t deem important.
Same goes with my timeline! I just want chronological order back. I miss out on so many posts that I am interested in. I often don’t see posts from friends and family anymore because the format doesn’t show me them. I don’t understand why I need to see posts from both 2 minutes ago and 5 days ago right under each other.
Not to mention the INSANE amount of ads I see on here now. The algorithm specifically is created to benefit it’s sponsors and ignores the creators on the app. I dislike that anyone can promote a post now. I get random posts of things I do not care about. If I do not follow someone, why do I need their posts in my timeline?
It seems as if everyone in these reviews agrees that all we want is the chronological format back. I don’t understand why the people who run this app do not listen to what their customers want.

Still good, not great (iPhone X)
I have pretty much the same comments as everyone else, regarding bringing back chronological order of the feed, stories being a ripoff of Snapchat (but I believe Facebook, instagram, and Snapchat are all owned by the same company if I’m not mistaken), etc. BUT ALSO, I just bought an iPhone X and the app needs some serious revamping be compatible with the new phone. They did a good job of having the layout fill the full screen view of the X; HOWEVER, when you go to upload a new profile photo, if you click on any photo besides the very most recent one in your photo album, the layout glitches, and the “Cancel” and “Done” buttons move up on top of the iPhone’s time and battery displays. I wish I could attach a photo to this review, but I hope my explanation makes sense. This glitch makes it impossible to click either of the buttons, and you have to physically kill the app and reopen it in order to get out of the screen and back to using the app. This happens every time you try to change the profile photo. If you use the most recent photo in your album, it works mostly fine, with just a little awkward cropping on top. This is just frustrating because obviously people might want to be able to upload ANY of their pictures as a profile photo! This glitch really needs to be worked out ASAP

Great app, feed flaws.
Overall, Instagram is an excellent social media app. However, I have found a few flaws in the way Instagram looks. For example, the comments are not in chronological order;making them very confusing. I have found a similar problem in the feed algorithm. They are not in chronological order anymore. You will see a post from 2 weeks ago, and then a post from 2 DAYS ago. Next, there should be a bigger time frame for videos. You cab only have a video that is 1 minute long. I wanted to post a slime review, but the video was 2 minutes long so I had to do it in 2 separate videos even though all of the slimes came together. Finally, I think you should fix the messages. You can always see if someone has seen your direct message. This isn't exactly a problem, but I think there should be an option, in case someone does not want people to know when they have seen their messages. Please take these suggestions into consideration. I know I am not the only person complaining about these things. Other than those problems, I have only had good experiences with Instagram. It is very easy and fun to use. You can share pictures and videos with your community or even the world! All in all, Instagram is a fantastic app, but needs a few fixes.

Is instagram deleting people for doing nothing?
Overall I love the app instagram, you can see funny videos and even gain followers on there, but here is the biggest problem on instagram, THEY ARE DELETING ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOTHING WRONG. Instagram needs to get out of their brain dead state and start checking accounts before deleting them because they are getting reported and accounts are being banned and disabled. This is especially unfair to the fan editors out there. There are hundreds of thousands of people who make edits of their favorite people on apps such as TikTok, Instagram, etc. These fans work hard on their edits, tag the people they edited, try to make their day by showing how much they love them just so instagram can delete the photos and videos because they assume that they are trying to be them??? Clearly if you read the caption you can clearly see that they are just simply showing how much they love that user. They are not trying to be like them they are just trying to support them. If they think people who show love to who they support then why don’t hate pages get banned, reported, or disabled? This isn’t the only people instagram has done this to because a nice dancer who did absolutely nothing wrong got disabled at 300k, the followers she worked hard on getting!!! Instagram needs to step up their game and stop doing all this bad stuff to these people who show their support or I’ll just have to be one of the many people who delete this app.

Instagram ruined my account!
I only had the opportunity to use Instagram for a week, and I spent that time following people I know, businesses I’ve worked for, museums, galleries, and shops I’ve been to, or hoped to spend time, and money with, and I watched a lot of hilarious, and fun videos. Then, Instagram locked me out of my account, and told me I had violated the user agreement by somehow hiring someone to do all that for me! What? I wouldn’t even know how to begin to do that. I ‘hearted’ videos, and posts that I liked. I followed people, places, and causes of interest to me. I’d hoped to switch over to a professional account, and point an arrow from Instagram to another site to sell my artwork, but by the time I was able to log back on Instagram(About 45 minutes) they had deleted all my saved links, and content from the past week! They never emailed or messaged me- they just did it! I deleted the account account after that- unprofessional! If I’d been posting things, and they’d suspended the account I would have understood, but I hadn’t even made my first post for them to judge what I might have to post or say! Unprofessional, anti-intellectual, and frankly they wasted my time. I’ll spend my time, and resources elsewhere, Instagram. Lesson learned.

Following activity page needs brought back.
Seeing what my friends like is 80% of what I use this for. This has been my main social media, and was my favorite up until this new year. Probably moving to something else. How can people be so out of touch. You’ve slowly destroyed this app over the past few months. I’m not sure if Facebook bought you out but it sure seems like it. This was a place you could really laugh with your friends and meet new people. But why not be snapchat? Why not be Facebook? There popular right? This isn’t just about this recent update, you’ve been deactivating “meme” pages for months and there’s a reason they get so many likes and followers. Because we enjoy them. I don’t plan to be with you much longer. Maybe give us a useful function that’s not something snap already has, or just keep taking key features of your app out that’s a good course of action. Maybe if people want to hide all the “ig models” they like you can add a setting to hide just YOUR stuff from your followers “following activity”. The only logical reasoning is people want to hide what they like, give them the option to do that on there own. This seems to be in favor of the ig models, now all these new people can like because there wives/whoever won’t see. And we all lose a way of seeing things people with similar interests like. Nobody wants to watch explore tiktoks, models, nba videos. I’m interested in more than what you feel like is “trending”

Had my account was shut down for no reason
I finally decided to get on instagram after my friends would not stop asking me to get on. And it was not a good experience, why because my account was shut down before even seeing the home page or whatever the first thing you see when the app is open. Now I’ll will tell you exactly what I did. I went to my App Store downloaded instagram next I clicked create new account, I entered my email address and chose my password then click next, the next window
Gave me the option to leave my email address as my instagram account name I didn’t so I changed it and then clicked next then the page glitched out and said that something went wrong and there was a button that said go back so I did that and I took me to the beginning to create an account so I entered my email clicked next and it said that this email already exists so I go to instagram app clicked on log in enter my email and password clicked log in and I get a message that my account was closed because I violated the terms and condition. I’ve actually tried again to create an account 2 days later using my work email and it did the same thing again. Idk what I’m doing wrong but I’m annoyed and done with instagram, that I’m just going to stick with Snapchat. Also don’t bother sending instagram a message because they are probably not going to reply back it’s been about 5 business days since I’ve sent them a message and still no reply.

New Update
The new update is absolutely annoying. I can’t see recent posts without having to click on older posts from people I follow. And if I don’t click on that it just displays ONE new picture from someone I follow. Every time I get on this app all I see is that. Which at this point has gotten on my nerves. Just that one recent picture which is 7 hours old now. Even if I refresh the page I don’t get an update of recent posts with other people I follow. Before the new update it changes constantly and I know some people that I do follow post on a daily basic. Change the format back. I rather scroll on my feed to see post of people I FOLLOW. Not the stupid suggest posts on my feeds. Change it back to how it was. This is incredibly stupid. It’s more stupid having another button to see older posts on my personal page. Stop putting explore page videos/posts of people I do not follow on the personal page. I get on Instagram multiple times a day and I do use the explore page a lot. Keep the personal page separate from the explore page. That is beyond ridiculous. Why are you changing the format? I don’t want to see suggested posts on my personal page. Change it back to where when I scroll on my personal page, it just displays posts from people I follow. Stop including the explore page on the personal page. KEEP THEM SEPARATE. Literally have a personal page button and an explore page button for a reason. Keep it that way.

every big update brings me great pain
I can never say that an instagram update has ever thrilled me in recent years. Every single time this app has a massive overhaul, the controls become even more clunky and jammed together, I don’t even know what it’s trying to be anymore. I’ve been on this app for 7 years. In those 7 years, the notification/activity tab has been in the right corner, just left of the account button. So it baffles me as to why someone would feel the need to move it to the most unconventional place possible. It is so terribly out of the way now, and not only that, it’s been replaced with a shopping button, so every time my dumb ADHD self goes to check my notifications, I’m sent to some bootleg Wish page. To whichever one of you working at instagram decided to cram the activity button into the top corner with 2 other tabs, I truly hope you have an awful day. Just an unpleasant time. I hope you get a parking ticket, and your car runs out of gas. And you go to the kitchen to find your spouse has tried a new recipe for dinner, and it’s just not very good. And your computer crashes at a very inconvenient time, and you were using an adobe product and forgot to save recently, so you lose a lot of progress on whatever garbage your team concocted to ruin the experience of your user base. I truly despise you.

Good social media app, bad user interface design
The app works for what it needs to work as. But for whatever reason, the user interface constantly changes and there is absolutely no indication that it is meant to change in their version history updates. It becomes slightly irritating that the app will work one way one day and the next some random change will be made to either the explore page or the home page that just doesn't make sense based off of its history. My example right now would be the new reels that were introduced. Now when I go on the explore page there is a huge portion of it being taken up by reels that I don’t want there. Sure, reels is cool but I went to the explore page, not the reels page. Another example that also happened recently was where I opened the app one day and my home page didn’t show any of the pages I followed and instead showed random pages. It took me a minute until I realized I had to click on “see older posts” before I could see the old posts. Not that I care for this too much, but it was just irritating for no reason to suddenly have pages I don’t follow showing up in the section of the app meant for only pages that I follow. That’s about all I can remember but there has been a history other similar changes in the past as well that I vaguely remember.

Regarding notifications
I never bothered to leave any reviews because I did not really have any issues with the app until now. Please REMOVE the annoying notifications of “people you may know”. I find notifications about people I may know extremely annoying and unnecessary. I don’t care about people I may know. I didn’t mind seeing the suggested people on the app but now I’m getting actual notifications about this and it’s really annoying. It’s always people I don’t know at all and there is no way to turn off these stupid notifications. I hate them, please remove these awful notifications or at least give us the option to turn them off because when I went to check to see if I can turn off this specific notification, there was no option to do so. The only notifications I’m interested in are notifications of likes and comments on my posts and when my friends send me direct messages and friend requests. Any other notifications I’m not interested in, but the other notifications at least have an option to turn them off. But these people you may know notifications are just annoying, useless and I have no option to turn them off. Please give us that option to turn these notifications off as I DO NOT want them! I’ll raise the number of stars once you provide the option to get rid of that annoying notification of people I may know.

Poor people love Jesus, 01/20/2018
Instagram discriminated against who can post what in the comments.
I was just on an NFL post about the Jaguars defensive stats having a plain old argument that even though the Steele’s lost that doesn’t make the Jags a better team... that has nothing to do with my problem. The problem is I typed a response to a commenter during the argument of which I was blocked from posting saying that Instagram keeps certain “guidelines” for the community... some generic message I’d expect if i was trying to say something racist or sexist. But no. It was a simple argument about football that I was blocked from expressing my opinion on because it didn’t follow “guidelines”. The comment had no vulgar language and presented my argument in such a way that there was no degrading or demeaning connotation toward the would be recipient. TAKE NOTE: This comment was made on an NFL post and I was blocked from posting my opinion AGAINST the team the post was promoting. This is not a singular or first occurrence as I’ve had this problem before with Instagram blocking me from posting comments that oppose the view(s) expresses within the correlating post. I quite frankly find this ridiculous amongst the sea of comments I read through on posts from news publications such as Fox. As long as you don’t disagree with the post you can same just about anything that isn’t immediately racist or sexist... but I can’t argue about football. Fix this.

Algorithm
I’ve been an Instagram user for a long time now and I really enjoy the app. Definitely my favorite social media platform. I, unlike most, really like Instagram stories and I love how you can save stuff without having to screenshot. My complaint however is my home feed. I’m tired of only seeing posts from 5 of the 200 people I follow. I wish there was a way to have it be in chronological order, but you can make it so that specific people do show up at the top of your feed. This may sound a little silly but it’s pretty embarrassing when you accidentally like and comment on a post from 5 days ago as if it was posted ten minutes ago. Really I don’t understand why Instagram is making all these frankly useless updates to the algorithm. Instead of that they should be cracking down on how the thumbnail (starter photo?) for a video has nothing to do with the video. Now that’s something that needs worked on. I feel that these algorithm changes only benefit the people exploiting Instagram and hurts regular users content intake. This is a little long so in short great app but please stop messing with my feed, or at least give me the option to change it back to the way it was if I so please.

Fix this please!
I really enjoy using Instagram but I have one issue and that is that when I try to upload more than one photo into one post it crops my photos to the same size as the first one in the post. I want to be able to post all of them into one post and have all of the pictures be the original size. This would be great for photographers like me who go out on photoshoots and want to put up one post with their best photos. It is hard to do that when all of your photos are cropped the exact same way. It should be the same way as Facebook. I am not saying we make Instagram exactly like Facebook because they are two different social medias, but I think it would be nice if we could upload photos on Instagram the same way we can upload them on Facebook. With Facebook you have one post with multiple pictures that are all the original sizes. You can then click on them and look through them individually before exiting and going through the rest of your feed. Instagram should allow us to have the option to upload our photos like this. We should have an option to do this If we have a photography account. I know not everyone would want to upload their photos this way but many would choose to do this.

Put it back!:(, 09/13/2018
SUGGESTION! How about an Option For Chronological order?
So I seriously like this app and following creators but I have a problem with how my feed is always set up. First of all, my feed is not in chronological order! The way it’s set up is very very unnecessary, I miss many posts from the accounts I follow! I also end up seeing posts from the second they upload a photo to the next post being from another person from 5 days ago! Second, since the way our feed is set up it keeps changing the posts every single time I come back to the app, again with the same thing, a post from 5 days ago to like 3 minutes ago. Like you’re lucky to catch one that’s very recent. That’s just so uncomfortable and very annoying. Please bring back chronological order or have an option for this!!(I seriously believe having an option is perfect!! It gives us a choice!!) It’s more helpful than accidentally missing a post because the way this is set up. Or completely miss a whole week of posts by someone. Anyways We have been trying to ask you guys for so long now! It’s certainly something we need back.


Thanks for reading and listening to the us users! Hope to hear back from you guys some time!

Needs Some Improvement
I’ve had Instagram since 2013, which is a very long time ?? It’s definitely changed over the years. A few problems I’m facing now, however, include my explore page resetting (I’d have to exit the app & go back in to fix that), and not having sound when I try to upload a video on an extra account.
I also feel that a few of the features that used to be on there were so much better and easier to get to.
Archived Stories, for example. Whenever your story would disappear after the 24 hours ended, you’d get a notification saying how many people viewed it. Now, that’s not there anymore, and I have to go to my archived just to see who looked at my stories.
Another thing is the hashtag following (or whatever it is ???+?). For me personally, I’ve never used this. I tried it once and just thought it was annoying cause the posts would go on my feed, and I’d be thinking that I’m just following these accounts when I wasn’t. It really isn’t the greatest feature to me, as I could just go to my explore page and find the same posts.
Regardless of these minor things though, I still use Instagram pretty much every day. ?? It’d just be nicer if these issues were resolved or taken into account by me writing this.

I was ok with it at first but then this happened...
So I went to go on my art account right. I go to check my activity and it says “we’re having trouble accessing your activity” and I was like ok maybe I need to refresh it. I did and nothing changed. So then I say ok I’m just going to post another piece of artwork when I go to post it, it wouldn’t post. I also tried refreshing it. It didn’t post. Eventually I was like ok maybe it’s my email. I went to go confirm my email and bam! Could not confirm my email I retried over and over again and nothing changed. I even tried turning my phone off and back on again even though I just got this iPhone 8 in December! When I tried it again after restarting my phone, it still didn’t work. So eventually I was like ok you know what, let me just log out and log back in.
I did that and what do you know, I COULDN'T GET BACK IN MY ACCOUNT AT ALL! It’s so hard trying to promote an account and get more people to follow along with your art and I had been building that account for over a year and a few months...all my hard work and dedication down the drain. And to put the topping on the cake, my personal account had also started messing up so eventually I just said you know what maybe I don’t need this app because clearly if I did they would fix things like this and prevent them from happening. So I might just not even try to have another account. I really don’t want to start all the way over again...

Not good
I know you guys don’t read these but I’ll write this anyway. Why the feed isn’t in chronological order is beyond idiotic at this point. No one needs the espn highlights from 3 days ago at the top of the feed list. Then as a fellow developer and finance manager of a company, I know facebook inc sells data to other tech company’s so they can find “look a likes” and such to target their markets better. But you guys have made it so obvious that you are just hoarding your users data to sell to the anyone willing to pay your prices. Like if someone tags a location in playa vista California, and the very next day gets sponsored ads in their feed for Apt’s in playa vista california. Hey cool it’s a business and you guys are great at it because the idea of your product is amazing. But every time one of these algorithm based add ins are included into your development the greatness of your product deteriorates. I deleted Facebook years ago because long before your political troubles it was glaringly obvious that the spirit of your product was dead. Facebook was no longer the cool party. Instagram is doing the same thing. At least give your users the option to choose. Most wont even care if they were given a choice (yes that was a matrix reference). But when most people speak of how gross social media can be. It’s not the users or content it’s how you guys choose to display it. I hope that you all could really do better because now it’s kinda trash.

Oh Instagram.
Honestly. If you would’ve asked me a little over a week ago I would’ve said, “ I love Instagram it’s the best social media app out there!” But , within this lovely week-ish. I’ve had my business account completely deleted with no explanation. Let’s add that it was AFTER I paid for a Instagram promotion and finished it. So they took my money, then deleted my account. I didn’t post anything more from the post that I put through promotion, just took the money and deleted it. And now after giving up on having my business go through Instagram I find today that I’ve also been logged out of my personal account, not deleted yet, but the account that I’ve had since I was in 6th grade. The account will not let me log in since I had an account that got blocked on this phone. So now I’m off of both business and personal accounts and being forced by Instagram to take an ig hiatus. I don’t understand why Instagram is targeting certain accounts through their apps, especially account holders that are physically paying them. So, please take a second to think about weather it’s worth it to run a business through Instagram with having the chance for it to be deleted with no exploration and no support from Instagram since none of their support outlets either connect you with someone or even work for what they say they do. Thanks for reading my annoyed ramble. I’m gonna go see if you can run a business through Twitter now.

Terrible Update
This new update has rendered the app essentially unusable. Ever since it was bought by Facebook, the UI has tanked severely, and isn’t user friendly anymore. The new positions of the buttons do not make any sense, the posting mechanism is hidden along with stories and reels, the DM system is 10x worse (trying to swipe out of a conversation can sometimes make you reply to a specific message which is completely unnecessary and unused), and at this point, I see more advertisements than I do my friends posts. The only reason any of these updates happened was because 1. Instagram wanted to make more of a profit by changing out the “notifications” section with “shopping” (a feature that most people don’t use) in order to bump up traffic revenue and 2. They changed out the “new post” button with “reels” as a way to compete with Tiktok. No one wants to do their shopping on Instagram, and if we wanted to use Tiktok, we would. Everyone who has been posting to reels has just been reuploading their Tiktoks, not making any new content purely for reels. Thr worst part about all of this is that if you have multiple accounts, these updates might not be present on all of them. Some of my accounts have the full update, and some haven’t even begun to change, which is extremely confusing. This review is longer than expected, but that just shows how terrible this apps interface has gotten. Don’t update if you can avoid it.

Fix it please
I have never made a review on something before. I absolutely loved insta it’s a mix between snap chat and I can also shop on it and I’ve found many small good businesses which is awesome, but I just deleted the app, because I have been dealing with hate, death threats, and harassment from an account run by 3 people. I clearly understand this happens on any social media platform but I’ve noticed it more on here. I reported them when they first started doing it after I stated my opinion on something they came into my dms and started mocking me so I had to make my acc private. Then they posted parts of the dm where I was clearly defending myself, I said nothing rude never harassed them back just simply stated why I believe what I do. Yes I know you can’t do much about it when it’s in the dms but when they publicly harass me and you can see their post that’s wrong. I then blocked the account and ignored it, but they all 3 made new fake accounts and did the same thing. I have been blocking all these accounts for about a month and can’t handle it anymore. I have reported their main account and get told we all have different views but pretty sure death threats isn’t something that should
be viewed had following community guide line. Instagram please stop worrying so much about the layout and fix the harassment and mockery on Instagram because I know it’s not just me that gets it.

Please stop making unnecessary changes
I am finding it harder to use Instagram with every update. Changes that are being made are unnecessary and feel unnatural to me. I can’t see posts in chronological order, I have “suggestions” on the feed which I go to see ONLY what the people I’m following have been up to. That’s been slightly annoying, but now in the explore feed when I click on one post with the intention to scroll through all the posts suggested to me from various users... instead I’m met with only one users posts, most of which I’m not interested in and it’s annoying to have to go back and click the next picture to see the next meme or what-have-it, causing me to close the app and open FaceBook or Twitter instead as they aren’t making changes that are majorly affecting the way users browse content. I don’t know who instagram has put in charge of these updates, but every single update gets worse. ALSO not to mention, the app will automatically follow accounts that I have either never encountered or had no interest in following. I have never left a review in the AppStore but Instagram used to be my favorite social media outlet and now I’m much more fond of other things due to some of the updates and I think a lot of people might feel this way about the path instagram is taking.

Not pleased
Instagram is the only social media that I use. One of those reasons is because of how Amazing I find it to be. I've never had a problem occur and all the features worked perfectly until now. I logged off of my Instagram app and when I tried to log back in, it popped up "We could not log you in" or "something went wrong". When this happened I thought maybe someone had blocked me and my account had been disabled but later I found out that if that was the case they would tell you whether it is disabled or not. After a lot of failed attempts, I decided to login through Google and not use the app. I was actually able to login. So what is the problem with me logging in on the app? I even deleted and reinstalled the app, but only this time to cause myself more problems. When I reinstalled the app, I clicked on the Instagram icon and then it just crashes. I'm very displeased with what is happening. I've sent feedback but nothing seems to be changing. This was the only way that I really had contact with the outside world and being on my page allowed me to feel free and express myself. Now I can't do that and I don't know if I'll ever be able to get my account back working again. I hope that this conflict is resolved, but until then I'm giving Instagram 1 star.

I cannot recommend this app
Instagram is a terrible social media platform with a horrible community with horrible bugs and only makes itself worse. I cannot recommend this app to anyone. I would delete this app in a heartbeat if I didn't talk to so many people on this app. The app tries reinventing itself and only makes itself worse by doing so. The app chooses the remake things that work perfectly on the app and make it over complicated instead of fixing actual infuriating bugs in the app. If you leave the app halfway through a text, the part of the text will show up in the chat every time you open up that conversation for a day or two until it stops for no reason at all. The app also chooses to implement other features that don't need to be added like changes to the profile page and making it more likely to mis-tap and hit a story button when trying to go back from messages than before. It chooses to implement these kinds of features instead of ones I, personally would really like like a feature to read all story's or better privacy. It also infuriates me that they have not chosen to make and iPad app yet. They know they don't need to make this app better because many people have no choice but to use it, like me. Do not get this app and save yourself your own time and brain power trying to understand what they were thinking doing some of the things they do with this app.

A sad user
My Instagram feed is now filled with posts from advertisers and accounts of which I don’t even follow. I never see my friends on my feed anymore unless I am scrolling for 10 minutes and people’s pictures are not getting as many likes. I can speak from experience because I have watched my likes go down as Instagram has changed their algorithm. People like things which are unique! Keep Instagram different and unique and make other platforms want to be like you, not you wanting to be like them. If the changes are based off of Statistics, realize the functions of other apps. Snapchat for instance, people like it simply because it is very private. On Instagram you are able to send pictures to people however they can be uploaded from the camera roll and used to look like the picture was taken just then.. this makes Instagram very user friendly for catfishes. Just keep the traditional Instagram aspects and forget about conformity. Make it so dm pictures- if uploaded from camera roll, it states that. Additionally, make the feed tendered to followers which a users look at most frequently.


Because of these issues with the algorithm, even though I used Instagram since 2012, I must say goodbye until changes are made :(

“Instagram needs a customer service number” SECURITY & SAFTEY OF PERSONAL LIVES !
Instagram has been a great app ever since I was around 10 to 11 years old I am now 17 about to be 18. I have had Instagram since 2013. However, Instagram seems as if it’s easy to hack into. My accounts have been hacked numerous times and I have tried anything/everything to try to fix this problem. I lost everything within my Instagram such as photos, saved videos, Instagram stories, my followers, my business, my followers, anything that’s within the app it’s self I have lost and I have put a lot of work into it since I was just a kid. Ever since I was kid I’ve had a dream and Instagram was my way of reaching out to the world/community especially around so I could share that dream with them (everyone has a dream). That dream feels slowed down and a bit ruined and it something I take personal to the heart with much care. I just wish whoever was doing this would stop. Instagram needs to establish a customer service app or addition to the company/service because this has not only happened to me but many others. Every time I log in my “IG” account get deleted. Please help me! If anyone supports this please help me out and tell me how to end this headache. It’s very nerve wracking knowing things like this happens to people’s account around the world. Instagram needs to be more secure! ??

Worst experience ever
Made a great account and was gaining a lot of followers but only ended up having it for 6 days because Instagram banned it. I had 600 hundred followers and was averaging 100 followers gained a day. The first thing they did to my account was make it unable to comment but that was understandable I guess because I was commenting a lot. They then lifted this after one day. I started posting again and realized my hashtags didn’t work because now they shadow banned me because (and I’m guessing) they believed my account was a bot. This got me mad but my account was still thriving so I did not care. They than started deleting some of my post claiming it went against their guidelines which I read later on and saw that it didn’t.i also made a promotion with one of my vids and had no problems and the next time I tried doing it with the same vid They said it went against there ad policy. Yesterday at 9p.m I went to check how many followers I had before I went to sleep and saw that they had banned my account all together with no warnings what so ever. They didn’t give me a chance to do anything. Today I also realized every account on my phone is shadow banned and I cant create any accounts anymore so yea long story short Instagram screwed me over and is the worst social app to date. Thanks a lot
EDIT: I’m now logged out of Instagram and can’t sign in to any account or make a new one and I’m not banned on those accounts

New Update
I love Instagram, it’s like a more modern version of Facebook thats basic enough for my grandma to understand but still fun for me to use. However I don’t know if this is a fluke or apart of the update. A message came up saying Instagram limits how much likes we can do on comments at a time to stop bullying... I just want to know who thought this was a good idea. This is a social media app that’s like the whole point, liking is literally the foundation of every media. If you have a limit whether your intentions are bad or not your going to end up being wiped for existence. And also I don’t know who thought a limit on liking comments would prevent bullying but that person has obviously never really been bullied in their entire life because that does nothing. The only thing limiting likes is going to do is leave Instagram with bad rating and have your audience delete the app and go to another platform that allows them to do what social media is suppose to be able to do. Speaking of such I won’t delete the app yet because I’m hoping this is a fluke but I will be switching to another platform, for the rest of the month, that is able to do its job. I appreciate the concern for bullying but find a way to help prevent it that doesn’t effect everyone and take away from the purpose of social media.

great app, some changes would be amazing:)
Instagram is a great app that I use on a daily basis, I love it and i’ve had it multiple years, but there are some changes that would make this app go above and beyond that me, and many others, would appreciate. First off, after you post multiple pictures in one post, you should be able to delete some pictures out of the post without having to delete the whole post. This would make so many users more happy because there are countless times when you accidentally post one picture in a group of pictures that you don’t like, but you didn’t realize it in time and you already have many likes and comments so you don’t want to delete the whole post and you just stay stuck on what to do. Also, if you creators made a way to preview certain pictures on a private account that the creator of the account puts up that would be amazing! It’s difficult to tell who some people are sometimes when you are only able see their profile pic so if you were able to select a few pictures from camera roll to put up (no likes or comments involved) it would be a huge help.


Thank you creators for the amazing app:)

1- Impersonation problem not addressed for months! 2- TERRIBLE for business accounts!
I’ve been having Instagram for personal use for a long time, but since a couple of months ago, things started to go downhill FAST.
First - Every single promotion I create in my business account says it’s approved, and still is not shown to ONE person. I’ve already checked every single thing that I could be doing wrong, but there’s absolutely nothing wrong. Great quality photo, right size, right content, insta page connected to the Facebook page, you name it. And that would’ve been ok, if it wasn’t for the drastic change in the algorithms, which have been showing my page to its followers every day less and less. The only way to get engagement is by paying them to run ads, and even when you do it, they do not work... such a disappointment!
Second issue - someone created a fake account of my personal page and HAS BIKINI photos, promising pornographic videos as if it is me, and even though I’ve already reached out to Instagram MULTIPLE times, and have about 100 friends who have reported the fake account, after 2 months ITS STILL THERE! And following every single male in my personal account. The account uses the exact same profile photo & bio as mine, and has blocked me so I can’t see it. — but I can see it through my business account.
Instagram hasn’t responded to any of my attempts to fix things for months.

It was great and now no one sees my posts
I’ve had instagram since I can honestly remember and I’ve always loved it. But recently I have started an art account and it was going smoothly the first probably 7 months until Instagram updated and now no one sees my posts. I’m not gaining followers because my posts aren’t recommended because IM NOT A BIG ACCOUNT. It honestly irks me to see how my hard work to draw and post almost every day is now basically all for nothing because everything is being handed to the bigger accounts. Smaller accounts are now butted to the side and ignored. There is almost no was of growing. I use hashtags, my story, and I posted regularly— yet my numbers still decreased with the new update. I feel like it is their way of saying “don’t promote? Don’t grow.” Sorry but not everyone is able to pay for that mess. I just wish everything was fair like it used to be. Why do big app developers always ruin something that was going so good? How can anyone else make it when they aren’t given the chances the bigger accounts once were given?


Please, backtrack and return it to how it used to be. I’ve had many other artists also complain and get discouraged because they feel the same way. It may seem like a problem only social media addicted teens would complain about but when you are trying to get out there and get known so that maybe you can have a career out of it, it’s a kick to the gut.

Fix in update
Okay so I absolutely LOVE Instagram. Recently I have noticed it is not loading all of the posts. I will go on Facebook and see a picture posted that states it is linked with Instagram but never see it on my Instagram feed. Also when you refresh it will take some of them completely off of the feed instead of putting them towards the bottom. Can you please fix it! This is causing people to not get any likes at all. My followers say they never see my pictures unless they search my profile. I keep seeing the same pictures over and over again. Some days I get half of the likes I normally do because people do not see my pictures. This is very frustrating.


Another thing that is annoying is the adds that I don’t ask to see. They are very creepy because they relate to the things that I like but that’s not why I got instagram. It seems like this app is trying to copy every other social media app such as Snapchat and Facebook.


I have been having this issues about loading pictures and my followers not seeing my stuff for about a year now. Can we please go back to the old instagram where everything was in chronological order?

Honestly this is getting annoying
You guys need to start listening to your users. Everything on here is just so messed up, the whole algorithm thing is annoying, and the feed/comments should be in chronological order. I don’t want to see someone’s post from two weeks ago I want to see the posts that were posted an hour or two ago. Also it isn’t fair that only certain story stickers are available to everyone. Yes I get that when you release things to the public it take time for everyone to get it so that’s understandable but when only some stickers are released to certain people that’s when it becomes unfair. I want to be able to add links to my stories but I can’t because it’s not released to everyone or not everyone has gotten the update yet. Also some lgbtq+ post have been taken down and honestly that’s just not right what is so wrong with lgbtq+ is it effecting anyone personally? No, no it’s not. Also being a depression help account on instagram I find it really rude that you take down posts that talk about depression/anxiety/self harm, then give people lousy websites that that so called ‘help people’ with that stuff. Just leave the posts up so someone can hopefully find the post and give/get the person that posted it needed help that will actually help them. Instagram please just start listening to your users or Instagram is just going to become as dead as Facebook.

Instagram is a bully
They will delete your account without any warning and it doesn’t matter if your content is good or bad. They don’t care how their users feel about the new algorithm updates. Don’t bother trying to make a complaint, no one will respond. Your content gets restricted or shadow banned depending on what you post or what hashtags you use. If you’re a conservative, don’t bother using this bias platform to voice your opinions, they will shut you down. You’ll see the same 20 people on your timeline regardless of how many 1000s you follow. Advertising is everywhere and can’t be avoided! Don’t post often? Consider your account deleted for not using it. The new algorithm makes you interact more with followers so that your content is seen but yet my likes continue to drop and more of my longtime followers have unfollowed me. When I message them to ask why they all said they didn’t unfollow me and thought I did. So not only does Instagram restrict accounts they don’t like or consider popular but will also remove some of your most active followers to keep your content from being seen. They act as if they are too good to be true but are really setting themselves up to less than MySpace in a few years.


I really suggest switching to Vero The True Social App! Been there a few months and I love it. Plus, they aren’t as strict as Instagram and you see content from all the people you follow.

It's good but I have some suggestion
I it enjoy Instagram, it is my favorite social media app. I love looking at other people's pictures and staying in touch with family members that are away. It is a source for a lot of my creative inspiration and I love that aspect. All the new tools that Instagram has incorporated into its app are so amazing and helpful. I look forward to the new features that they will one day include in the future. One that I hope they include is the ability it add/edit postures once they have been uploaded. This is something that I struggle with all the time, whenever I'm posting multiple pictures at a time using their sliding picture format, I cannot add onto, delete, or rearrange the order of these photos. I recently just uploaded a pair of two pictures to my page only later to realize that I forgot to add a third photo that I was planning to put. I think it would be helpful if Instagram added an option to edit pictures in such a way that we are permitted to edit captions. I do not wish to delete the whole post, but to simply add one more photo to my post. Instagram please listen to this message for it will help my and several of my other friends who struggle with this same issue!

Feedback and suggestions improvements
So, Instagram is like pretty great, it’s my favorite social media platform. However I wish that the creators could make a few improvements and adjustments.
First of all, I know that there’s a highlights section for your stories, but I wish there could be a folder to combine posts. For example, I have a drawing account and it would be nice if I could have a place in my account where I could combine posts from past months. D’ya know what I mean? I tried to screenshot all the posts from the past month, but it was just too much work.
My second point is about stories. I know that y’all have added polls and “type something” features. What if you added another feature like those two but the responses were anonymous to the person who posted the story. Sometimes I wanna respond to one of my friends, but I feel embarrassed or insecure about my answer. This feature is not a necessity, nor a need, but it would attract a lot of attention to the youth, like me. Anyway, I believe that these pieces of feedback will liven up the app. Hopefully y’all add at least one of these in. Sorry for the long post, I had a lot to say, obviously.

Needs to fix glitches in the app
Instagram has always been my favorite social media app, however, recently I have had VARIOUS problems due to malfunctions within the app. At the beginning of September 2018, I was logged out of my Instagram account for no reason at all. No big deal, I’ll just log myself back in, right? Wrong. Every time I tried to log in it said an error had occurred. I logged into my Instagram through the safari app to make sure my password was correct, and it allowed me to do so. Now knowing that I was using the correct password, I tried again to log into my account through the Instagram app itself. No luck, once again. I contacted Instagram through email and they said there was nothing they could do about the problem. It is now March of 2019 and the problem is still occurring. Instagram needs to fix this situation. Which according to Google, multiple people are facing similar issues as well. Please Instagram, fix these glitches within the app or help the people who are facing these problems. This is a very irritating problem and the Instagram Team just seems to push it to the side. This is not an efficient way to run a company.

Used to be a fan
Used to be an avid Instagram user, but since the change in post order Instagram doesn’t interest me anymore. I see too many posts that are days old from the same profiles and hardly ever see the profiles I want to, I usually have to go to the users profile to see their posts. I’m also extremely disappointed in the new explore tab, there has to be millions of posts from users out there but I see the same (maybe) 100 posts repeated throughout. I refresh often and try and click as many different photos as i can, and I still end up seeing repeats more repeats than new photos. I originally liked Instagram because of the simplicity in communicating and sharing with friends, but am now realizing I’d rather learn to communicate on another app, it’s not worth being a part of Instagram anymore when it only shows me what it thinks I want to see.??
ALSO YOU HAVE DELETED SO MANY OF MY FAVORITE PROFILES because they “do not follow” your guidelines when they are not breaking rules. I see celebrities get away with posting nudes and inappropriate pictures everyday like Kim kardashian. I also have several spam nude pages that try to follow and harass me that I have to block and report. Please re-evaluate your guidelines because you are ruining influencers lives when you take their platforms away for breaking no rules. Please start implementing your guidelines on celebrities and stop hurting influencers.

Since Facebook took over I.G.
Just wanted to mention to those who are are concerned , that I stopped using Facebook because of the obtrusive nature of Facebook in the use of my data and exploiting it for purposes that I have not agreed to, nor would I... Instagram seemed like an option that was a platform made for users that enjoyed and appreciated each other’s photos and small bits of commentary versus Facebook‘s rabid feedback loop of everyone including strangers who would be able to comment, and so often disparagingly so, on your content. Instagram at the time, seemed like a mountain lake of peaceful interaction versus the stormy seas that Facebook and it’s deluge of content and ads had become. When I started using Instagram there were no ads pushed onto my feed… Now there are and not just a few, but regularly inserted into my stream that I follow. Some of these ads have products which according to the reviews, could be from companies that are less than reputable… So already it’s begun..Facebook in it’s march to monetize all aspects that it touches is now slowly but surely souring The Instagram platform with it ads and I’m sure eventually with other products that will supplant what Instagram originally was to be about… I will use it until I tire of this which could be sooner than later… We shall see.

Instagram as a whole ever since I got it last summer has a been a great experience for me. I’ve been able to connect with my friends faster than I would’ve without it, and it’s a good thing to have when I’m bored and have nothing else to do. However, after having Instagram for many months I have discovered a couple of issues that are driving me nuts. First, on the home page once every so often the several most recent posts get mixed up in a seemingly RANDOM ORDER. I don’t like this at all because the post that gets moved to the top is most likely a post that I don’t want to see again for a while, like today that post is one that I don’t like at all and would rather not see AGAIN, and also because I someone who likes his home page posts to be precisely in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. Second, when an Instagram update comes around, the caption for it should say more than just fixing bugs and issues on Instagram, like what exactly that update is going to do with certain pages on the app and why. Please take the time to deal with these issues that I’ve stated above so that in the near future I’ll be able to confidently give Instagram a FIVE STAR RATING instead of a four star rating.

Great, but turned out horrible! ????
I installed Instagram because the app said you needed to be 12. I had it for a few months and eventually my posts totaled to about 80. I had taken pictures of holidays, trips, vacations, my family, and my dog. For a while, everything was fine and I loved the app, but then I made another slime account. I made this account and started using both of them. After a few days, I was asked to put in my age for some reason on my first account. The one with all my memories. I put it in and the age said I was 12. I then had to try to put in my age a few more times, but I put the same age in. I then was forced off of my first account. I clicked the button to save my pictures, but it didn’t work. I was so confused because the app said I needed to be 12, but I got an email saying I had to be thirteen. The app said YOU NEED TO BE 12 NOT 13!!! I was so mad and upset. All of my memories were gone and I couldn’t recover my photos. This needs to be fixed and I want my photos back.
Another problem with the app is that you can’t have more than 1 account with one email. I had to start using my family’s email with their permission so I could have 2 accounts. I don’t understand why you can’t have 2 accounts on one email. If o want 10 accounts, I will need 10 emails. That absurd. Can I pox’s have an explanation on this.

Some issues
While I enjoy this app, I've been using it for 3 years, there are some recent issues that have been bothering me. All the updates have just been going downhill since the chronological order of your feed was removed. My feed is a mess of the same people over and over again with posts from many days ago because instagram thinks I want to see that stuff above everything else. The "solution" was to help you stay up to date with the posts you miss, but now I am missing more posts in my feed than before because of this system. I recommend making it an option in settings to turn on chronological order of your feed, it would make things so much easier. Another issue I have is that I recently noticed that the accounts you follow are no longer in chronological order either? There seems to be no organized way they are put in order, it's just like it was randomly thrown in there like that. This proves to be very difficult for me to find accounts I have recently followed as they no longer show up at the top of my followed box. I am following over 1,600 accounts so I have a very hard time remembering the name of an account I just followed. I just wanted to find one account and now it's lost in the many accounts I follow. Please make these changes, it would make the app so much easier to use.
