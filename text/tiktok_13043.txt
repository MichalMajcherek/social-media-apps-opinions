Sophie says don't get, 11/10/2020
TikTok
Are you thinking about gettingTic Tok well don't think about it just get it. I rate this app a 10 out of 10 and here is why. So in Tic Tok you have a home page and it only shows the people you are following you also have a for you page. In the beginning right when you get Tic Tok it asked you to put in what you like to watch so you do that and that is what comes up on your for you page.


You can also make you account private or public. When you make videos you can make them about anything Gaming, Drawing, Coloring, Cooking, Baking, Dancing really anything its your choice. You can also choose if you want your videos only to be seen by the people that you followed or only by you. When you make a video and you think it is kind of good but you don't want to post it you can put it in your drafts so if you want to post it at some point it is saved and you can. I got this app because all of my friends had it and it was totally worth it. I do suggest that anyone under 11 should not have this app it. Had some cuss words but the amount seemed to go down. If you really like a song but it has a cuss word in it there is options for if you want t blur it out.


Tic Tok is really fun you can also message people but only if you have a phone number. I really suggest this app. I love it and so do my friends. That is why i am rating it a 5 star and 10 out of 10. If you get the app I hope you have fun and enjoy it.

This is an okay app.
This is an okay app because every time that I delete it and then the next day I try to get it back I have to make a new account on it and get all of my fans and followers back and I hate it!!!!!!! I have to delete it because there is so much bugs and stuff that it glitches me out of the app. Then I have to login AGAIN and then after like 2-3 hours or so it glitches me out AGAIN therefore y’all need to go in and fix it please. About the updates. I think that the new updates are cool and all but....... I hate it that you guys got rid of the emojis I loved them and I was also wondering why you made us clocks/muser’s like why can’t it just be one thing instead of me telling my friend to get the app and her being confused about which name it is. I also hate that you have to reach 1,000 followers to get lively. I fell like lively should be for anyone who has tic toc/musically like come on people. What if someone can’t go viral because they only have 690 followers like not everyone can get that far like me I only have about 30 and getting to 1,000 it’s like “what the heck is wrong I thought that there was no certain amount?” I’m confused and having to buy stuff on lively like that’s stupid I’m sorry but I don’t want to wast my money like why can’t there just be adds. Can you please fix this.

Endless creative and inspirational creators
There is so much good here. I am an observer. New to TikTok by a few months. But what I have seen is amazing.
From the loud motivation of the mouth popping mama, the soft spoken lady Leah who missed her calling as a motivational speaker, to the be better crew, and the you’re awesome cup holder and let’s not forget the red bearded x school teacher and SupDaily’s good morning walks. Entertaining Mini series by the mafia crew and tv mimic skits like Friends. POV content from so many that truly makes you think. The military down range support started and lead by CSM. Interactive music, new music creation and independent promotion. Large groups like the Bangtan Boys to small self starters who are extremely talented. I can’t forget the old classics used in new exciting ways. The artists who put brush to canvas or pencil to paper blow me away with their skill levels. I could go on and on.
What is most amazing and what they all have in common is they have the same goal in the end. Just to make the place we live a nicer, more compassionate, giving world. To make sure everyone pitches in to help each other and to love life no matter who you are. It’s a pretty awesome place to spend time in. I will continue to observe with a smile, laughter and a few tears from time to time.

Here you are!, 07/05/2019
Here’s a review !??
I enjoy this app a lot and all the thing that you have added is wonderful! The only problem is when you report someone, it doesn’t do much. I think that you should be able to report someone and they would not be able to go on with doing the same thing they did, though thankfully- more than one person has to report the user, but indeed I have an idea you could add! The person should be active on their account at least 3 days so the same person does not report them with different accounts they are making. I suggest this app for many people that should be at least 10, basically double digits due to multiple swears that are allowed on this app. Maybe more edit options like, example; Camera swinging from on direction to the original video. This app is definitely absolutely perfect for people who enjoy making videos for others to see and enjoy! Though maybe make accounts get to the for you page more since its uncommon people search up a hashtag and find your video. Though I absolutely can’t stand this app, it’s amazing! And for another suggestion you should definitely add, make notifications for people messaging you and not allow spam if that is already added to the app, I suggest this app for you if you are looking forward to getting it! Enjoy ??

more to tik tok
i LOVE tik tok so much. i think i speak for most of the population when i say that basically all i do during quarantine is make and watch tik tok. however, there are a few suggestions that i have. my first would be that there should be a dislike button on videos. a lot of the time if there is a controversial video people have to like it to save it which gives that creator more clout. if you put a dislike button, it shows the creator how many people he/she truly upset. i understand why that could be a bad thing but maybe try it and take it away if it gets too bad? this next suggestion is one that i have thought of since i got the app. when i really like a video, want to recreate it, show it to my friends, watch later, etc. i put the video into my favorites. however, i now have so many videos in my favorites that i can’t even find the video i need at the time. for this issue, i wish so deeply that the favorites section had different folders that you could name. this way, when you go to put the video in your favorites it asks which folder, you could name a folder, watch later, dances, show to people, etc. tik tok is a great app but please please please take my last idea into consideration.

Great App but...
I think TikTok is a great app to be honest! It has help me grow in all kinds of different ways and is kind of addicting in a good way. However, I feel like there is more that TikTok could do to improve the app. For example, you should be able to see who duets a video. I feel like it would be easier if we want to see other people’s reactions and want to share that as well. I also feel like we should be able to have a story that is up for 24 hours so we don’t have to make videos about something we want to share that is really not that important. In addition to that, we should be able to repost videos on our story as well. I saw a really REALLY good danganronpa edit and it was SUPER underrated but I couldn’t share it with anyone because when I duetted it, it only got 2 views in a day. Also, I think we should be able to go live (like a FaceTime on live) with other people. It would be super fun! We used to have a feature where we could pin comments, but we can’t do that anymore? Which is kind of disappointing, but if you can do that again, it would be great! We should also be able to pin videos incase someone is new to an account and people want to introduce themselves.


Anyway, I think that’s about all I wanted to share to help TikTok grow as a community and app.

THIS IS IMPORTANT PLZ READ
This app truly is great! But I think you should really start taking the report system more seriously. When I go onto this app I see great content but after a while scrolling I see hate comments and hate videos and when I report this stuff all I get is”This is not against our community guidelines” when YOU say that it is and I get so mad that you guys allow this stuff on tik tok. Tik tok is supposed to be a fun great app with positivity and NOT hate but with the reporting system this is just not true. Another thing is this app is so confusing. It took me two months to figure out how to do only half of the things on tik tok!! And I still don’t know how to do most of the things popular creaters can do! (I’ve had tik tok for two years now). It’s like this app should have a instructions!!! So I would really like it if the app could be less confusing??But other wise this app is AMAZING!! I would still COMPLETELY recommend this app!! But just ONE more thing?? I don’t think this app should require WiFi because this is ENTERTAINMENT. When I’m on a road trip and I’m board I go on tik tok and I realize I have to connect to WiFi BUT I DONT HAVE WIFI. I really think you should fix this please this would be a great update!!!!!

Good until it bans you for no reason
It is a pretty good app and I loved it. It kept me intertwined until my friend and I took a video together and she was wearing a pretty big sports bra. It cover everything except her stomach. My video got banned even though charli and Addison and other famous girl tik tokers were short shorts and bikinis. I thought okay well I guess that’s okay to get banned. So I kept posting and everything was fine. At that point only one of my videos got banned. I hadn’t posted in a couple days so I decided to post a video of the song “Thank you next”, by Ariana grande, org pictured of horses at the barn I ride at. Just the horses themselves and at the end I put a picture of me and another horse. It was a selfie and you could see a lot of the horses face but a little bit of mine. It got banned and said I was permanently banned from my account. For no reason it should be banned. I was wearing normal clothes and you could only see my face. I have no clue why it got banned and I’m really upset because that was a really good account and every school friend I had and or friend followed me and I got a decent amount of likes on each video. I’m am really mad at TikTok right now. Like did the horse not wear enough clothes. Seriously...

I wish there was a way to customize things that trigger us
For me, politics are really bad for my mental health. I’ve been trying to put not interested every time I see a video but they still keep coming. I wish there was a way to like block certain videos but just for me. Like I know it’s important to be aware and up to date and all that but it’s not for me. The same way things liek eating disorders or assault or depression and stuff. I don’t think these should be banned for everyone bc some people need that information or should be aware or whatever, but it can be triggering and annoying in a bad way like ur always just reminded even if u just pass by the video for some. And there should be levels to it too. Like one level will be don’t show me any video, then the next be I can handle a few/you. An show me a lil, then I’m ok w seeing these and also I’m interested in this topic. But only w potentially triggering stuff. (Trust me it’ll be overkill if u let them do it w every topic like fashion, or diy or lgbtq, they have to earn their spot in those sides of TikTok) And I know it’s hard/impossible to not show alll the videos in that topic bc it may not have associating words or topics in the hashtag or caption or comments or whatever, but this will def cut down which is still helpful.

Duet Glitches
hi, my name is makenzie hill. And i’m having some problems with the duets. For example when i want to make a duet with my favorite Creator Jayden Croes, i’ll make the duet then when i look to see how it turned out, it’s like the video will be fine for a bit then it’s like mine goes faster or something, and not in sync in Jayden’s like how i first made it. I noticed it only happens when, i do duets with someone who has a lot of transitions in it. But still, can you fix it, because i’m known for making in sync videos with my favorite creator Jayden Croes, and when i make them on sync it’s like my video will go ahead of his therefore messing the video up, and i keep redoing it but it still happens. next i would love you to add a feature were because i like doing duets with Jayden, he has videos were he records with no hands, and then sets the timers to a certain point for it to end. why, is it that if you want to do a duet with that person you can’t hear were they stopped it at and the second they stopped the music at??? but if you don’t duet the video you can here the sound, and the second but if you duet the video you don’t??? i really hope you fix it because i really love making videos with him?? thank you.

Love the app but I want the old Version back
I love musically lots but the new update just makes me hate the app. When you try to type in your bio you have a maximum of 20 letters. It is horrible. Sometimes with my bio I tried to change it and it won’t let me I even counted my letters and numbers and it wasn’t even 20 sooo..Another thing is when your scrolling through your feed it goes “Your typing to fast slow down and take a break”. What is that supposed to mean. Transitions are hard to do with the new one and I’m confused with a lot of it. If you do update the app all of your privates go into Drafts. Which you can’t use the audio you saved to your privates anymore. There is an option where you can save your videos private but they fill up your whole feed like on the old musically you could just click on your privates and they would all be together under one thing. One thing that is really making me mad tho is I can’t see how many people have seen my musically when I click on it. It only shows the number of likes but who knows if those are the exact number of likes. The only way you can see how many views is on your main profile page. There is only one good thing about this new update the new filters but other than that that’s it. So for those of you thinking about getting the new update don’t get it. I love musically just want the old version back.

Horrible Update And Bugs Got Worse
I have had musically since the app launched and i can honestly say, it was great at first but slowly got really horrible and a toxic community. I cannot use my wifi while on tiktok, i have to use my LTE data. I have tried everything but it simply will not work. Instead of taking down cosplayers sfx make up videos !that have trigger warnings! Down, take down the bullying accounts and sexual pages that have been up for years. I get that the app is meant for 14+ but there are still underage kids on the app that report videos for no reason, or simply because they got offended by the video that had a warning on it. Instead of taking down the video, actually veiw it, then take it down if it doesn't follow community guide lines. Don't take down a video just because a 6-9 yr. old reported it because their parents said not to watch it. They clearly got angry because their parents got on to them. I'm a cosplayer and am personally sick and tired of the youth on the app that report the lgbtq+, cosplay, gamer, etc. videos just because they did not like it. I hope that tiktok actually takes the time to read the reveiws and try to improve the app. I am very dissapointed in how this community has grown. It went from a fun friend making place to a toxic, full of hatred, unfair community in the matter of seconds. I would comment all my complaints but i do not want to tire out the people that read the reviews on apps.

Love the app, but....
Hi, first I just wanted to say that I absolutely LOVE TikTok and use the app on a daily basis, but I have noticed a few things that bother me. The first thing is when you are uploading a video, you can’t save videos,sounds,etc. This bugs me because there a several times I’m on the For You Page and I want to save a video or sound, but I can’t because I’m uploading a video, and then I will accidentally lose the video or sound and not be able to get it back. The next thing is I only ever see people with 1.5k or more likes on my For You Page, and I would appreciate it very much if it were easier for smaller accounts to get views, because most of the time the smaller accounts work just as hard as the larger ones. The last thing is about the comments. I wish people couldn’t limit the comment section to only ONE person. I understand if it is limited where only friends can comment or if nobody could comment, but I feel like limiting the comment section to only one person could make people feel not welcome and it is a big waste of a comment section. Thank you for making it this far in my review. Once again, I LOVE TikTok but these are just some small things I don’t love.

Bullies allowed to thrive
So overall, I love this app and how creative it’s gotten! This truly is a place where people can share their interests and grow as a community.


However, the issue I have is that they are currently doing a very poor job at keeping bullies off the app. Recently, several creators have been harassing and threatening others, the most recent case being from a creator (with a very large platform of 1.1 million followers) who used another’s painful past to promote her own agenda, and telling him that he’s no better than the person who violated him. Videos like that are constantly reported, but it takes less than a half hour for Tik Tok to send back an automated message that the content doesn’t violate Community Guidelines when it very clearly does. This app no longer feels like the safe space it was.


I understand there are a lot of users, and it takes a lot to manage such a large platform, however when a video is reported dozens of times for violations and nothing is done, but videos of other people talking about why the original vid was bad are taken down, it gets discouraging for us all. Overall, the app is a cool place, with lots of effects and ways to create and manage videos and comments. However, the harassment and bullying rampant right now almost makes it worth not being on.

great game but some ishues, 06/27/2020
The bad side is what makes it horrible.
The people on here are so toxic! Every time I comment my opinion I get attacked and it RUINS my day! Not even gonna MENTION the creeps on here! I’m not an angry mom or karen, but I think if something is innapropriate on there, it should be taken down IMMEDIATLY. I’ve made A LOT of reports, and only ONE of them got accepted. I’ve reported someone who told another to KILL THEIRSELVES and the victim that got told to almost DID! If something looks fishy, then I suggest to take down that account and ban them temporarily. Also, PEREZ HILTON SHOULD BE BANNED!! IDK WHY HES NOT! He litterally wants teens off this app, but the app was MADE FOR TEENS, adults and five year olds just snuck on there. I get like 10+, because that’s the time they start learning, and have health class, but 9- SHOULD NOT, I repeat, SHOULD NOT BE ON TIKTOK WITHOUT A PRIVATE ACCOUNT. My sister is seven years old, and she’s on private, no trouble, but there’s some FIVE YEAR OLDS on here, that don’t have restriction to any nudity or innapropriate stuff, then they think it’s okay to make. The parents find out and blame you, that could get you POSSIBLY SUED! This isn’t a safe app for kids 9-. On the bright side, if there’s a vid that says, “Opinions are available here, no fighting,” I love it. Healthy and strong opinions with no arguments within it. This app is very fun and addicting, but there’s some things to change!

Overall
TikTok is a fun app for teens and some adults. There are cool trends to follow, fun hacks, DIYS, cooking/baking, technology, dance, etc. It has taught me a lot of very useful things, and has brought a lot of joy and entertainment. However, there are some cons to TikTok. First of all, it takes up a lot of your storage. I would suggest making it so the videos don’t save to your camera roll. Second of all, it takes up your battery very quickly. Third of all, it is very distracting and not so good to be on all day. Fourth of all, it is not included on the App Store for MacBooks which is frustrating because I need it considering my phone might break and I like to post daily or once every two days. Fifth of all there’s quite a bit of inappropriate content around the app, and Finally, there’s a ton of negativity circulating on the app. Which is shocking considering we are all isolated during a worldwide pandemic when we all need a lot of love and support. One thing I do like though is the other side of the people who stand up against the horrendous hate and negativity, and trust me I’ve seen horrendous things. So all of those cons just take away one star, because other than that, TikTok is super fun, and somewhat educational.

TikTok
TikTok is a great app, but I feel like it would be even better if viewers like me and everyone else who likes to from time to time watch some Tik Toks in a short period of time. For instance: you would like to show a friend something funny that you watched in a Tik Tok, ...unfortunately it was at the end of the video. So now you have to wait to show them the absolute comedy gold. At first that doesn’t seem so bad does it. Although something to take in to consideration is that not everybody has time to watch all of a video just to get to the good part. That’s where my idea comes into play. I think that TikTok should make a feature that includes fast forwarding and reversing the video to the exact point you want it at.
Otherwise I love this app. It is a way to be yourself and be creative in your own way. If you don’t want to do that, it’s also a good to pass time or just have a few laughs. Better yet it’s a way to find common ground with other people who like similar stuff that you do.
I personally like it a lot, but I know some don’t. And that’s ok with me. And if you decide you like it too. I’ll also be thrilled. In the end it’s you opinion of the app. This is only what I think of it. So what I am trying to say is I like, but don’t feel like you have too.

Great app but alot has changed..
I LOVE TikTok! It made me have better relationships with my friends and it genuinely helped me become a more confident person. But over the past few months things have started to change, and not in a good way. TikTok has stopped put Lgbtq+ and comedy videos on the FYP. (People call this “shadow banning”) Instead of funny videos and videos that make me smile, I find myself feeling trapped on TikTok. I use TikTok to express myself and have a laugh once in a while, but now all I see is politics and inappropriate dancing. There are only a few good videos and everyone hates on them. I miss old TikTok, where if I was sad I could feel happy. If I was insecure, I would learn that I wasn't alone. And I know its great to spread awareness and share the news, but I’m always getting in arguments over who’s political views are correct. This app is mean’t for children and teens. It’s supposed teach you how to spread positivity. Most if the time I learn about dangers in the world faster than my parents. Most if the people on this app are too young to be into politics, including me. (I am 13) And yes, we should know whats going in the world, but not nearly half of the things shown on the FYP (For you page). I loved this app, but I’m starting to drift away because of its new content.

Best social media platform ever!
I love TikTok. I personally use TikTok to have something to do and talk about to my friends. It’s basically all we do, sometimes it gets out of control and we start making TikToks in the gym of our school during lunch when we can get suspended, but, you gotta do what you gotta do for TikTok. Usually people are really nice and supportive but people can get out of hand with shaming people as a joke when it’s really not funny at all, I’ve even caught myself hating it just comes and goes and I try to stay away from it. TikTok is my most used app and I have 30+ hours on it every week and idek how. There are a few things I would change and it would be that you can have more control who views your videos. I still want my friends and the public to be able to see my videos but also I want to be able to block a specific person from just one video instead of blocking them from my Paige. That would make you feel a lot more comfortable with posting because I’m not the most popular kid in my school and there are kids out there just trying to put you down for fun. But overall great app and I give it a whopping 5 stars even tho there are a few small problems. :)

It was great until
Ok so TikTok was great until i would try to make a TikTok and once i was done with it it would delete it and i tried to make like five TikToks with different sounds and it does the same thing i also think that it is annoying when i get off TikTok for like five minutes and then when i get back on it it make me repick what i like to watch and also tell me how to swipe, so i think all it needs to do is fix whatever is happening and all of the other things is good. Oh and i think everybody should be able to go live it is stupid that you have this amount of followers or likes for you to go live and i think you guys are picking who go on the for you page because everyone has a chance to go viral but you are inly letting certain people do that because my stepsister did a TikTok and it was just a remix of different TikTok songs and she said, “whoever can name all of the songs gets a prize!” And then it got like 22k views and like 890 likes but all of her other TikToks get 2-10 likes. Another thing that they need to change is when you are on it for a certain amount of time and them it decides to say your tapping to fast and also that why the heck do you get a notification if someone you aren’t even following is live?? Like why it’s so stupid. So i think TikTok should change a lot of things.

Great App, Bad Management
The app is very fun to use, especially for cosplay videos being that it is easier to meet other cosplayers on tiktok than ever before. The music is fun, and all in all it is supposed to be a FUN app. However, the app has become littered with 9 year olds that report every video and/or view content that they shouldn’t and that to me is just not okay. The people who work on TikTok seriously need to work more on how they monitor the app. A feature to make your profile only accessible to those 13 and older would be great ( its not like the app started out as a 13+ app or anything, no way, that’s not why there are 7 year olds using it now ????+? ). That way, if a cosplayer wants to make a post with, say, SFX makeup that looks gory someone isn’t gonna come around and report it for no reason, because the profile is 13+. I dunno this feature and a lot of other features could be added to make the app better. Cyber bullying on tiktok is worse than ever right now, and I just hope that the app becomes a safe place to have fun again like it used to be. If you like music, messing with transitions, making new friends rather easily, etc. ... I recommend getting tiktok, if you are easily offended- it probably isn’t the app for you at the moment.

I love the app but a few bugs
Hello TikTok, I really love this app I have had it ever since it launched in 2014. I use it on a daily basis with my family and friends; but I really have been wanting to go live and say hi to all my followers! They mean the world to me and it is so sad that I can’t just talk to them and interact! Sadly, I have to have 1,000 followers which in my opinion is a little bit hard to get! I know that TikTok headquarters is really trying to improve this app and I think it is going great and you all fix all the bugs! I just think it is a little unfair that only the people with lots of followers get to go live and none of the people with a average amount get too. If you don’t want to drop the follower amount that is fine¢?! I just want to share my opinion! Another concern I have is the reporting! Half of my videos have been taken down because they are “violating community guidelines” but I strongly disagree, a video of me singing go t taken down! I really put effort into it! It made me really sad! It makes no sense because half naked girls are on there doing who knows what while I’m over here singing but their videos stay up for the world to see please fix this! I really love TikTok and it would be so sad if I decided to delete it because of these issues.

Awesome
It’s really fun I’ve been on it for almost 1 year, there’s really inspiring creators on TikTok. But watch out for scammer profiles. But there some mean people too, but there’s people everywhere so. That’s basically it of what need to watch out for. I would highly recommend getting TikTok. It’s a really fun app. And also you have the option to turn off the comments or duet/react and you also can set your account to private or public. And make sure to report scammers if you see any it will really help TikTok fill with more safety and if you see people bully other people please report them too, it really helps TikToks positivity. So when you go to create your first TikTok you can choose all different sounds even make your own. Make to look at the trends to on there. There’s a new challenge everyday. There’s also filters and face filters that you can choose from too. You can also look at the “for you page” and the following page (only people you follow are on there). And if your account is private, people can send you follow requests you can either approve the follow request or disapprove the follow requests. My account is private I only accept the people I know. That’s basically a summary of the app.

Couple things...
This is a review that I am adding after being on the app for a long time. Ive made a lot of videos on my account, and Im always making videos that are fun to watch, but go along with the guidlines. However I think the report and appeal system is very bad. I recently made a video that was actually me doing a trend that is on tiktok for halloween. It's a trend where you pore candle wax in water, and it will create the first letter of the person youre gonna marry. I tell you this because its a silly harmless tiktok that everyone is doing. About 3 minutes of me posting the video, someone reported it, and it was immediatly taken down without question. I was given the option to appeal which I did because the video I made didnt go against any guidlines (which I made sure to read to see if I actually did something) about 3 more minutes go by, and I'm told the same message except now it says that my appeal was denied. I understand we need this stuff for actual offensive and dangerous content, but I feel the reporter has too much power which leaves the appealer to have almost no say in the matter whether their video was offensive or not. Please fix this, I've dealt with this before, and many other popular creaters have as well and we're all tired of it.

Love it but some problems..
I have joined TikTok last year on my iPad Mini, posting videos everyday. Though I have some concerns that should be brought up. For starters, I am personally dissatisfied about having to wait an hour without liking anyone’s videos, It would be nice to like people’s videos without running into a problem. Another concern is not having enough fans to go “live”.
I had hopes to go live a few weeks after I started my account but I haven’t had any progression. Honestly, I think you would need just 100 followers to go live on the app. I also don’t like how TikTok puts all famous people on my “For you” page, I would like to give chances to smaller accounts, such as account with at least 30 followers. It would also be nice if there were less ads. When I first open TikTok on my phone, I see an ad about a trend or another app. I’m also scrolling through the For you page and see some random ad that doesn’t need to be on TikTok, although I know some ads promote movies. Another concern I have brought to attention is the use of cuss words. Cuss words have been found in almost all of the videos I watch. I am disappointed in the sound, and it gets to my head. Other than those concerns, I am proud to be apart of the TikTok community!

Dear TikTok
I hope TikTok dosent get taken down because honestly this app is amazing... it keeps me busy and it keeps me entertained! When I first downloaded this app I was 15!!! At first it was called musically ! I had at least 400 followers. And then TikTok was made! And I started watching people’s videos and I started making some of my own! I started to gain a lot of followers and I just loved doing TikToks it made me happy! I started to gain more when I got pregnant and having so many people follow my journey.... it was amazing to have so many people watch my belly grow and seeing my baby grow. It’s really touching ! I would love if this app stayed because we need it and we love having all this fun. I love all the TikTokers and it’s fun seeing them all make you cool dances for us to do. So I’m hoping this app stays because there’s a lot of us that want this app to stay for ever.... there’s just a bunch of memories on this app. We can’t take it away from them. And I would be so sad if all my videos and all our hard work went to waste! I have too many h videos of me and my belly growing and just watching all my viedos. And looking back. And see where I got here. So please don’t take away this app. We love it too much(:

APP EAT MY LOVEEE, 10/14/2020
Not so good.
I don’t think this is super good it’s only because I see stuff that make me wanna vomit. And I see violent stuff on here. And there’s people sending messages saying ‘cut you’re ####’. I can’t say it for sure. And there’s people sending disturbing messages and other stuff. Another one is ‘send me #####’. Please fix this, this is not safe for teenagers to anymore. They wanna see teenagers ##### and just no. I’m not letting this app pass without it checked and reviewing. This app is unsafe. I’m sure this app if for 45+. I’m deleting this app forever. I’ll come back in 26 years. This app is just to unsafe. I cannot keep up with a safe app, it became to unsafe and just isn’t for kids & teens. Please fix this app it’s just to unsafe for my age as well. Teens don’t belong in this app to. It’s way to fun, I’m addictive to it. But it is a bad app so I deleted it and now I’m reviewing it. Thanks for this wonderful app though. I mean this app is amazing. The app of truth. Just don’t downland it right now because I don’t like the disrespectful disruptive messages they sent you. Please don’t downland right now until it’s fixed. This app is becoming way way to unsafe and only for 34 year olds or older. So I’m coming back 26 years later. I’m gonna see if this app is fixed and back to normal how to was in the old days. Bye and just reviewing.

Amazing(a few cons tho)
Ok so i’ve been a muser since 2016, and at first with the Tik Tok update i wasn’t happy at all. I thought i would hate it and a bunch of worse things would have happen. After time i began to love it so much i have over 1k and i have a little issues but i’m fine with this not being fixed “as soon as possibly”. So one of the problems are the for you page, once and blue moon you’ll get on it, (unless your super lucky) and i would work so hard for it and never get on it, i came to think of it as in just not quality video enough for it and that’s alright! Another thing is i like to find random small accounts and like atleast 30 of their videos good or bad, but i can’t do it as often now we have a “limit” on likes and comments (which i think is really dumb). I have one last issue and that is that videos are being deleted for no reason!!! i had a really popular one of mine deleted and it made me super upset even tho it didn’t have anything wrong with it. Same for live streams innocent people get suspended because a 9 year old reported them. Thank you for taking the time to read this! I would love it if you could atleast fix one of these problems!!

Overrated & Dramatic
I had this app with it first got a lot of attention as musically. I didn’t care for the whole lip sync thing but preferred watching those who made very creative photos or makeup/sfx. I used it as a way to spread my creativity making aesthetic videos and doing my own makeup. However I never understood how someone lip syncing to a random song got more famous than some of the creative artists that I followed who had a pretty decent audience. It just made no sense to me how these people where so popular. However I got through the phase and stopped using it. Then recently at the beginning of this year it got popular again as TikTok which I thought was ridiculous cause I ended up deleting most of my videos as I found them cringey to look back on. Now people do ridiculous dances that isn’t even dancing like seriously whatever happened to old time swing dancing? These tiktokers are overrated and tend to have the worst petty drama like grow up. And because I don’t like TikTok doesn’t mean you have to give me death eyes. We all have opinions just like how most of the world seems to like to do ridiculous dances. Also my old account is hacked now. It has a phone number in it that’s not mine and I’ve always had the same number. I reached out to TikTok twice but of course I receive no help and there’s not even a way to delete your account or atleast that I could find. Not helpful, overrated, dramatic, and ridiculous dancing.

“Under Review”
I love Tik Tok, and I’ve only had it for a few months. It is a great place for me to cosplay, the community is friendly and supportive, and I can do more than take photos now when I’m in cosplay. However, the past month and a half every time I try to post my videos go immediately “under review” and some stay that way. My videos don’t go against any guidelines. I even had videos taken down, and I would message asking why it was taken down, but no response. I would rewatch my taken down videos confused how it goes against community guidelines. Especially because I see similar content on my For You Page. I recommend not harping people like this. Because it’s frustrating to me that I put hours into making TikToks only for them to never be seen because they are kept “under review”.
I recommend not putting peoples videos “under review” until someone reports the video for going against guidelines. And send a reason why, that way it will be clearer on why the video was taken down and what the creator can avoid doing in their next TikTok video.
I love TikTok and I want to keep using it, but if the server is still going to keep me from posting then I might leave. I’ll try and contact TikTok if the issue isn’t resolved because I know I’m not the only one to have videos constantly under review.

Musically
I love musically it’s such a fun app and many ways to express your personality. I love all the filters and the effects for them. But there are some things I would like to bring up and bring back. First, I don’t duet a lot of people especially when there strangers, but I can’t seem to duet with my friends without them tagging me and it’s really annoying because it also does that with my friend to. Second, the privates thing is annoying and u can’t put a video in your privates anymore if I want to duet it. Third, I did some spooky musicallys with the new effects, but they took off this really cool one where everything’s black but it outlines everything and I think that was a really good effect and I was sad when they got rid of it. And lastly, this one isn’t really a big of a deal but Ive started doing redos from my first musicallys but it’s so annoying trying to get back all the way down to the bottom of your account, if u could plz add something to make this easier that would be amazing. But like I said musically is a very fun app and I recommend it 100 percent. Thanks if you read all of this even if your the creator of this app, I’m very happy with this app and I would be disappointed if it got deleted from the App Store.????????

Literally only two complaint from me
Okay so i have only two major problems with this app and that first being that when i have to log out, to keep people from snooping in my phone and getting into my stuff, all my drafts get deleted. Like some im saving for a day when i can’t do anything but i still want to give my content to my fans but i log back in and its all gone. So then i have to get back into those cosplays and redo them. While yes, this gives me a chance to fix any mistakes in the previous cosplays i had, i still want to be able to go back later and see the progress i have made. So can you keep the drafts there just maybe put them under a security thing? So that if you have to lock them in case you get hacked or my situation happens nothing will happen to the drafts?
My other problem is that you guys have a set up for notifications from what users we want to see. So i enable the notifications on a few of them but i never get notifications despite seeing their content later. I set up notifs on my gf so i can support her and gets others to support her to but anytime she uploads, i never get a notif. Its usually us chatting later that she asks if ive seen her new tik toks and i am just like shook.
So basically please fix the drafts situation and the notifications please?

@Sparklekittymeow's review, 09/27/2020
Downlad this app!!
TikTok DOES take up a lot of space but I 100% think you would like it. There is a way you can be famous and you can see funny videos that Vine never had. So I do have one complaint and that is that tiktok does take up a little more space on my phone then I want but then again TikTok can’t be perfect. There is something called a “For You” spot on the top of your screen people might talk about it a lot they might comment on a video saying something like “FYP!!” They are referring to the For You page. If you open the app it will most likely take you to the FYP, on the for you page there is stuff that tiktok thinks you would like to see.( such as funny videos or art videos) if you double tap your screen on a video then that’s how you can like a video, to follow them you can click the plus under their pfp ( profile picture) then you can go to the “Following” page at the top and there you can see the content that the people you post. Like almost all apps you have to make an account I can’t help you sign in but I can tell you that TikTok is a fantastic app so please consider downloading it. Yes I know this was long but thank you for going to read my review.

Best app
It’s so much fun to make videos get likes and get followers also I love how you can watch other people’s video's there are a lot of effects and NO GLITCHING OMG BEST APP EVER I would rate this app a 10/10! It’s really well made but I would say make sure you are 11 or older to get this app there are so many fun things and when you first start you can pick witch category you want to see some or the categories are dance ?? music ?? animal ?? art ?? funny ?? and so much more and you can pick from more then 1 so I like to pick art animal and funny are my fav but you choose your favs so I highly recommend this app it’s one of the best apps I use it almost everyday and it’s so much fun! Just to scroll through videos and one of my favorite parts of tiktok is when you hit the follow button then go to the next page you can see only the videos of the people you follow I also like this app because some things people say are very nice like.. this person send you this video to say you are beautiful! Witch is so kind and it’s not like you are scrolling through videos that are 20 mins long they only let you film 60 sec or a min or 15 sec for songs so yes I highly recommend this!!

Please read!
Tiktok is a wonderful app. It’s takes up most of my day. It’s also probably the most entertaining thing I’ve ever been on. Although it does have some down falls. Like videos can be taken down for no reason, videos that clearly do have a reason to be taken down stay up. For example, I made a video doing a dance and my grandma came in and hugged me. Guess what it got taken down?! I was wearing pajamas and she was wearing a baggy shirt with joggers, so it wasn’t clothing related. Here’s where it’s weird bc that got taken down but videos showing inappropriate content gets to stay up. Another thing is that people get told to kill them selfs on a daily basis but they don’t get in trouble. People get body shamed and bullied on this app but nothing gets done about it. Randomly tiktoks get deleted for absolutely no reason. It’s like tiktok is picking and choosing. It’s not fair to the ones to follow the rules in this app and still get deleted. Also live shouldn’t be debated on how much followers you have. Tiktok is an app that everyone has grown to love but it’s not always a place for everyone bc of all the hate and picking and choosing. I love tiktok and thousands of others do too. So please take what I had to say into thought to make tiktok a place for everyone!


Thank you. ??

TikTok is great, but...
So, I’m a cosplayer and we’re a fairly big community on TikTok. The problem is, TikTok shadowbans us. Our content is not shown to the world, causing our hard work and efforts to go down the drain. I have to constantly keep making new accounts so people can see my content. You shouldn’t shadowban people for using the same tags over again multiple times. It makes it clear what its from, what character, what the video’s about, etc.
I’ve had to take down videos and reupload because you shadowban my account and nothing is shown to anyone. Even after reuploading, it never seems to get anywhere either.
I spend SO much money for this and you trash it like it’s nothing. Its cruel how you do this. As much as I may hate the app for this, I still remain on it because of how happy it can make me sometimes. It gets hard to enjoy it when all you do is shadowban and delete my content. It’s unfair and disgusting.
At least let us KNOW before you go ahead and block all of our content. Like, give us cosplayers a warning, and then we’ll start using different tags, or calming down on our posts a little. We aren’t spamming the hashtag or making inappropriate tiktoks, we’re making our cosplays known. It’s insanely difficult to do that because of this, and it angers me, as well as many others, a lot. Fix your app, it’s horrible.

?I love this app sm?
So this app is kinda my life. When I bored, I watch tik tok. If I’m in the car driving somewhere, I watch tik tok! You really should get this app. It is filled with people who create amazing content but be warned...
??????THIS APP IS ADICTING??????! When I want to go to bed I will be like “ oh, let me just watch a couple tik toks, then go to bed. But that is NEVER the case??. I just keep scrolling through the videos as the time tiks down. When my mom wants to do chrores and stuff, I always get distracted my tik tok lol! But, if your kid is trying to get this app and you are looking at the reviews to see if this is a good app for your child... IT IS A GOOD APP. There are bad videos but there is bad things everywhere. It’s like saying to your kid, “ I’m so sorry but you can’t go play with your friends today because you might get kidnapped so you can never EVER go ourside again, sorry.” You can sherif your kid from the world. Let them be free!! When I am sad I make tiktoks and it makes me happy. When I am sad, I watch my favorite creators, and it makes me feel so much better. If you have gotten to this point in the review. Then good job. All in all, THIS APP IS AMAZING! Get this app please. It will be worth it????

I’m having many problems
I’ve had tik tok for about a year now, and it’s one of my favorite apps. It’s got some major issues though. First of all, I don’t have a post button. Where it says drafts, there is just one button, and that’s to add the video to your drafts. I have looked up videos on where it is, because I guess I just don’t have one. I have put a lot of work into making tik toks, but I can’t even post them. Please at least tell me why this is happening, or if I’m just being dumb, tell me. Second of all, whenever I try to search ANYTHING, literally anything, it says “sorry this feature is currently unavailable” and I can’t search up anything AT ALL! It’s just super anoying, again just tell me if I’m being dumb, but I don’t think I am. Also it’s the same thing for writing comments :/ Third of all, I DONT HAVE A “FOR YOU” PAGE!!! I enjoy watching tik toks that are related to the ones that I already enjoy. But I still, have looked through the entire app, but I don’t have a for you page. Please try and fix these issues, because I think that they ruin almost the entire experience for me.


(Also I have an iPhone 6s so if that’s something that effects the way that the app works, sorry about that, but I mean idk)

Tick-tock
I feel like TickTock is amazing app but to make it less addicting would be great because I knew once you delete it if feels like you need it back and it’s so hard to resist it because you can find suggestions like you might see your friends under suggestions or you can see family members even or even people over on your neighborhood and then it’s like you can see them and once they follow you back it’s like you can kind a text them and be better friends with them so I love that and also I love showing off like what you can do like it’s fun when you can show your talent to other people but I do feel like it is very addicting that is one caution I give to anybody who wants to download it it’s very addicting and once you get it you’ll miss it if you delete it because it’s just like you’ll miss being able to show your talent like the world kind of through your phone and being able to text and communicate in different ways like my videos together and make like a free account and being able to just show your own towel at all of that you’ll end up missing it other than that it’s pretty much a five from when I had it

5 star app
I LOVE tiktok. It’s not just an app where u endlessly scroll for hours with a blank expression. It’s a community, a family, even. On tiktok, you can see videos that will make you laugh, cry and also make you feel less alone. Everybody on that app goes through things together and we ALWAYS have one another’s back. It’s a safe place. We have inside jokes together, and I think everybody my age on tiktok can universally agree that we are a family. Tiktok helps me get through my everyday struggles. If I’m feeling down about something - tiktok will provide me with thousands of videos of other kids going through the same thing, even videos giving me advice and comforting me. And if I want - I can post a video venting about the thoughts and feelings bouncing around in me. Internet friends will always find it and support you. There are always dark corners on social media apps, but so far, I haven’t encountered a single one on here. People find their community on tiktok, because there’s so many of us here. It is a way for people who live thousands of miles apart to interact and bond like good friends. It connects us all.


Thank you, tiktok,

The problems with Tik Tok
Tik Tok obviously is not a platform for children to be browsing on, so I don't understand what the problem is with a little bit of adult humor. There are way too many people who get offended by little things. For example, I made a video simply following a trend of doing a certain dance aggressively. Out of nowhere, a ton of people started hating in the comments for "being rude to the creator of the dance" by doing it aggressively. Then in a week or two, the video was "under review" and still has been under review for 4 weeks now. Tik Tok rarely ever responds to reports and also shadowbans way too many good content creators. These content creators are probably the reason a lot of people still use the app, so why shadowban them? They're just helping you expand your platform to multiple types of audiences. Also, the views system must be addressed. I have over 20,000 followers and a lot of my videos maintain a very high like-to-view ratio, yet they don't receive nearly as many views as one would expect that it should get. For smaller accounts, this continues to be an issue. Less views means less exposure, which thus means less followers. Tik Tok also seems to tend to give my less successful videos way too many likes, which have a horrible like:view percentage. These views should instead go to the content that people like more.

best app ever??????????
i love this app so much it gives me something to do, it keeps me occupied, and overall so much fun to use. i think this app should stay and not get banned, this app lets u express ur creativity and gives u a chance to be famous. this app can help u with ur homework, give u ideas to make videos and overall have so much fun. the quality of this app is absolutely stunning. if we didn’t have this app i would be bored all day and have nothing to do, this app impacts so many young ppl, they can grow up to be influencers if this app stays, taking this app away with scar so many creators. there are many influencers who’s career revolves around this app will then be unemployed, those ppl include charli and dixie d’amelio, addison rae, avani, and all members of the hype house. this app can help show awareness for diseases and disability’s, and help grow a new company, this can also help sponsor people and products. i don’t think this app should go because this app make so many people happy and this app has been around for about 3 years and hasn’t given anyone trouble then so why it happening now? this app is one of the best ones i’ve ever seen before THIS APP SHOULD STAY!!!!!!!????????????????????

Sooooo.
Hello! Like many others none of my videos get on the for you page. The first few have. But now I’m wondering why would I even bother making videos if no one will appreciate them?! My account is ham_money. I am very upset about this feature of the tik tok mechanism. I think that tik tok she give every account a chance to be on the for you page of different people. And also I think there should be a dislike button regards sending hate comments. Also the reporting problem. Far to many people report accounts for no reason. A lot of my favorite tik tok creators are suspended because of numerous reports that make no sense. I think before you can ever report you should set out a questions and answers, to see if it’s really serious. I have tried to contact tik tok many times and nothing has happened I would very much like a explanation, AND a answer. I would like you to try to fix all of these problems. Thank you. I understand this may be hard and stressful. Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my time to listen. Oh and also don’t send me the same response you send to everyone. I liked through the reviews. It’s the same exact answers! Thanks!

Love the app but it has some problems
Look I love this app and have made several friends because of it but I recently got half of my videos audios muted and the shadow banning needs to be fixed it’s getting out of hand. The tiktoks I like are being unliked without me doing it. I’m tired of having to save tiktoks I like because of this issue. I’m not the only one having these problems. Several other people on the app are and a lot of them are cosplayers who spend hours getting into their cosplayers before even turning on a camera. This app needs to have major things fixed. Also blocking certain tags is ridiculous one of the tags that used to be very popular for cosplayers was banned and you can’t find it in the search bar. Any tiktok with the tag is automatically deleted. I love this app very much which is why I’m leaving this review here hoping it helps at least a little bit to getting these issues solved. Please fix these issues. I am aware you can’t do much about all the under 13 kids on the app so I’m not going to get angry about that because that’s almost impossible to monitor especially for a free app. Please try to fix these problems. I know I And many other people want them fixed as well.

So one day I saw my cousins and my friend watching TikTok which I was curious to see what TikTok is it’s kinda like musically but musically was kinda cringe not gonna lie or not trying to be rude so I didn’t download TikTok YET. BUT one day I was really curious so I finally downloaded it and- HOLY I- yes this is the best app it’s really entertaining yes I’m kinda addicted yes I love to watch these videos they can be funny sometimes there are so many good creators like Charli, Dixie, Tati, Avani, and many others people which yes mostly all my cousins watch TikTok now xd tbh this is the best social media app I ever seen I go on it everyday because I love this app and I think you did a great job on this app and I’m still wondering how long it took you to make this app and how because I bet it took you so long and you put so much hard work on this because TikTok is a really good app and people if your reading this you should download TikTok yes there can be SOME drama on this app but it’s ok cause like- this app is so good and yes creator you are so talented this is probably the best app of social media because it’s so entertaining and fun and creative and everything.

TIKTOK ISN’T AS NICE AS IT SEEMS!!
However this may seem like a great app to dance to music but you don’t know it’s deeper than you think, tiktok like many other apps can see your location but tiktok takes it to even creepy ways. Tiktok is still running in the background taking information from your phone , it’s takes passwords and different sensitive information in your phone, even the drafts you don’t post are being send to a Secret Account in China leaving it easier for hackers to break in and take sensitive information in my opinion you shouldn’t download tiktok. This makes it harder for you to feel safe in your own home because tiktok is always watching you. And even before you make a video tiktok takes the video and scans your face and they find out who you are and takes that into a data base to secretly watch you which is the creepiest thing I heard all of my life time. Do you parents want to know that your children are being watching by some Middle Aged people taking pictures of your kids. This app also takes your ip Address leaving you unsure of your safety in the place you are in. PLEASE DON’T PUT YOURSELF IN HARMS WAY TO MAKE A VIDEO PEOPLE!!!

Unfair community guidelines
I absolutely love tik tok. I am so addicted and so are all of my friends. However, I feel that the video review process is a bit odd. Many videos contain curse words, but curse words are counted as a violation of community guidelines when used in captions or comments. Many people post videos of them drinking and will mention in the caption that they are of legal drinking age and that they do not recommend underage drinking, yet will be penalized for it (when many other videos are not). I once posted a video that was inspired by several other videos on the app, which contained short clips of each friend of mine drinking, and then passing the drink to the next person. My video was taken down due to a violation of community guidelines, so I submit an appeal mentioning how everyone in the video was 21. It got put back up but got barely any views, so I reposted it. It got taken down immediately and they did not accept my second appeal? It does not make sense and was not fair considering they accepted my first appeal. I can see that many other people have this problem and I just wonder why they are so strict when some of these videos that violate community guidelines are actually great (and extremely popular) content.

Stupid but addicting.
Once you get into tiktok it’s a like a little world. But I have some complaints.


First off, the lives. Only people over 1000 followers get to go live, which I think is ridiculous. Maybe you should give new users around 25-50 followers when they first start so at least they have something. Secondly, you need to fix your issue where people randomly get suspended by their lives for getting reported. When someone is reporting you should make it a REQUIREMENT to have evidence and if they don’t have any, their complaint is invalid. Thirdly, the age limit. It needs to be where people only up to 20-25 should be able to sign up, minus “thebentist” and the other cool, family friendly tik-tokers that everyone loves. I think this because girls and boys are constantly getting verbally harassed by older people on tiktok, such as the Budday. They are being forced to do things they don’t want to or see graphic things. Or are tricked to give personal info such as their number, email, etc. These are just a few of my complaints. Please work on these because these are universal problems on TikTok.


Thanks!

Live
Tiktok is a great app! But when when it comes to people going live there are some problems. One of my problems is that why are we only able to go live if we have 1000 or more fans. That doesn’t make any sense because if you have a small tiktok page then maybe if you go live you can get more fans. People With 1000 fans or more are not small tiktok pages. I only have about 90 followers so if I go live I could possibly get more fans. But since you can’t go live unless you have 1000 fans or more I can’t get more fans from live. I also have another problem, it’s also about live. So I was watching a tiktoker on live and I left for about 10 minutes and when I got back on the live ended. So I just so happen to see a video of her saying “ I’m so sick and tired of people reporting me for being under age when I’m literally 19 years old” That mad me and her both upset. So you should take off the feature were people can report them for being under age so that the person going live has a far chance to verify that they are not under age. Like I said tiktok is a great app but when it comes to going live things need to be fixed.
