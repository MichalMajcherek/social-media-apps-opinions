Love it
Obviously the funniest social media. Y’all are better than the competition but please don’t do any more minor changes. I know it’s not a big deal but moving the bookmark position is quite annoying when we’re instinctively used to it being in the original spot. Now when it’s moved we still click the old spot without realizing and end up having to start over. Also not being able to retweet something without first going to the quote retweet page is manageable but also like.. why would you do that? That ones not as bad but if you keep sneaking in these micro changes then you might turn into Snapchat / Instagram / Facebook and the younger generation (like me - 21M) wants to move on to something that isn’t constantly minorly irritating us. You, Reddit, & TikTok are the main things we use and y’all haven’t been changing too much like your competition but I would hate to see Twitter lose it’s steam because they want to make a quick buck that ends up ruining the app. Just my 2 cents.

the new update is not great 2.0
The new update is super confusing to me. Where before you could follow a thread of replies intuitively, it is a lot harder to figure out who is replying to whom. It’s strange how in a social network you have to expand replies so much in order to see every single one. Isn’t the whole idea of being asocial network to be social and see feedback easily? I used to use twitter on a daily basis for friends and news but due to this update I have been avoiding using it. Learn from the old tumblr. Too many replies makes it hard to comprehend what is being said.


Edit:
So instead of changing how the replies look you decided to make it so only limited people can reply? Interesting wrong choice. One of the most appealing parts of twitter is that anyone can reply. Yes, it can be annoying because of arguments and such, but that means that people looking through the replies can see multiple points of view on a situation. Limiting this is a way that misinformation could spread. With Twitter’s strong take against misinformation in the current political climate it’s a surprising move to ease lies and half truths being passed around. I’ll repeat what I said above with the first update that changed how replies looked “Isn’t the whole idea of being asocial network to be social and see feedback easily?“

Twitter is a great platform
I really like the idea that we, as Americans, have freedom of speech in a way to express our opinion just as long as our morality in the ethical sense stays on the side of respect for one another. I did say morality within the ethical side of humanity in a broad and hopeful approach, but that is our goals, I would imagine, and I don’t think that anyone maliciously tries to hurt one another, it just happens by way of scars, and how people deal with their anger at whatever level that is a standard for their life. This truly is a tremendous platform, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I’m sure sometimes my personal life filters into my tweets, or whatever it is that has been done in reality, which this is truly reality, but sometimes that world tweet world out there seems much further away than what we actually see, and do in our every day life, not on the Internet. Thank you for creating this Mr. Jack, my respect is endless. Have a great day!!

I Love Twitter !
Thank you for releasing me from Twitter prison. It gave me time to reflect on the evils of my whiteness and conservatism. Shame on me. ??
It also gave me time to watch Dorsey squirm for answers (lies) before the Senate and especially Ted Cruz. That alone was worth prison time. Take note, Dorsey, so when YOU’RE doing REAL prison time, there’s ALWAYS something to do. You just got to be a little creative, that’s all. Anywho, thank you once again for ALL
that you’ve done. Trust me when I say this - it will NOT be forgotten. There’s an old Chinese proverb dating back thousands of years that STILL rings true today and I stumbled upon it when I received my fortune cookie at “Wang THIS” the other day as I picked up my self distancing meal in Midtown. It goes like this -
“The Wrath of a “patient man” is something to be feared.” I’m not sure what it means exactly but I wanted to share that with all of you. Have a GREAT day and remember ..... when you least expect it, EXPECT it. ??

Twitter is the perfect image of the double standard of the media and the American culture
I'm actually not worry about the reaction of you guys if I write a honest review and that is the consequence of your own policy and rules. Probably you have the power to cancel my account but I really don't care. For me Twitter represents more than ever the double standard of the media and the American culture. The result of the bias of your platform with your algorithm trying to silence the opinion of an important sector of the population for me is a coward action that demonstrates you don't deserve my trust. I can continue using your platform because I like sports but you won't be able to change my values or change my opinion by canceling or blocking someone in your platform or manage to place all comments or opinions that are in line with your narrative in first place after someone you don't like makes a comment in your platform. People is not stupid, they realize how bias you have become and how controlling, manipulative, fake and dishonest your o platform is.
Good luck in your mission to make America a place where you can't freely exprese your opinion. Some day these actions will hit you back.

Social media destroying America’s future!
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc driving stupidity in millennials and nations youth! These idiots waste so much time on these worthless products instead of being innovative and reading and gaining knowledge. Instead these kids waste hours taking worthless photos, to share so they can grow up to get followers like the skanky Kardashian’s. What’s worse is the Social Media toilets are paying these idiots that pump up followers. Next we have the social media services being a tool for connecting Hate Groups. Before social media hate groups were somewhat isolated, but now with their supreme leader in the White House, Hate groups can now use these highly detrimental networks to raise money and use fear tactics to grow followers.. and the idiots in charge at these social networks have no clue as to what’s going on!! Prove me wrong and 1st destroy all the hate group access IMMEDIATELY! Then bring something of value to social networks and not the extremely stupid crap you have there now!

Tech support is garbage, email support is garbage
made my twitter account almost 10 years ago an was an avid user on that same account. i was using the app and then sat my phone down for about an hour. when i reopened the app they were asking me to log back in to verify my account. Seeing that I haven’t logged out of twitter i was confused as to why they started to ask me this.i’ve had this account for a long time and the email address i signed up with is one that i no longer had access to. because of this i was unable to reset my password. i tried emailing tech support but they gave me some excuse saying that they couldn’t verify the account and that there was no other way that they could do so. they’ve never asked me to do so before and i am very upset with tech support. i would’ve rather talk to an actual person to explain my problem than send an email that they took a long time to respond to. so now im stuck trying to figure out what my old password was because i don’t want to create a new account. its been 2 weeks since this happened and im very disappointed with their service and lack of communication.

App is great until you need support
I’ve had twitter for about 8 years now and recently have been locked out of my account due to age restriction. I’m currently well over the age to have an account but due to EU regulation twitter combatted this by locking accounts made by people under the age of 13. Being from America, I don’t understand why that should affect my account yet here we are. However that’s not my biggest issue. I’ve never had to use twitter support until my account got locked out but because there is no email or account not on twitter for twitter support, there is no way for me to contact the support team for help. If I try to submit a form, it says my account is locked. I can’t send a message because my account is locked. I made a new account but it will direct me to send a message from my locked account, which then proceeds to tell me I can’t submit a form from my locked account. Twitter support needs a serious revamp considering it’s only useful for people with WORKING accounts; if my account worked then I wouldn’t need to contact twitter support in first place!

Hatred
It has become a cesspool of misinformation, hatred, bigotry, and racism.. And I’m talking about the executives and employees of twitter..They have no right to be the arbiter of the truth. They are biased and have an agenda based on advertising dollars and their stock price. They have started down a slippery slope, and I’m switching to some other platform where there is free speech from ALL viewpoints. Not what some Silicon Valley executive who only cares about the Twitter stock price deems to be the truth. To the twitter executives, you created a big mess and you are a disservice to humanity, and possibly the spark that could end us all if you begin to stifle the truth and free speech.


Updated: the Twitter app should be pulled from the App Store. I have witnessed incredibly violent material and videos including people’s heads being blown off. This material is not flagged nor taken down, while people that only express opinions are directly censored if they don’t meet a certain narrative. This is a dangerous slippery slope


If apple wants to be a company that promotes privacy, free speech, and freedom of expression it should not allow apps like this one. It is a dangerous weapon for humanity when great tools are subverted.

Perhaps this is a better way to get through to YOU
I have been on Twitter for almost 10 years now, and I love the app. However, two weeks ago you sent me an email saying I supposedly violated the rules and I would be locked out of my account for 72 hours. Well guess what, it’s been 312 hours later and I’m still locked out with absolutely no contact from you whatsoever as to when I can get back in to my account!! I have tried several times filing an appeal as to the suspension, yet ZERO contact or answers from you AT ALL!! Did I say something harsh to someone, yes I admit that I did. I did NOT however promote any violence or supposed hate, or threaten someone’s life. I consider myself a conservative, and if that’s the problem you have, then just admit that’s the problem to me and everyone else and we can all move on. However if you allow a liberal or left leaning person to say whatever they want with no repercussions, then I’m afraid you are going to have a much bigger problem on your hands. So please, for the sake of humanity, just respond to me and tell me how long I’m going to be locked out for so at least I can move on.

Nunu20026 on Twitter, 10/30/2018
I’m really irritated at this point!!
Every time I try to takeoff the sensitive mode it doesn’t wanna take it off. I tried doing the instructions on Google I’ve tried even just going through all the settings and change and everything differently and that’s not the half of it, I’ve had my account blocked or suspended just for following people I’ve been suspended just for a re-tweeting a tweet I’ve had so many problems with it and I just got it this month and it’s really aggravating and I had a couple of accounts but they were so long ago that I didn’t even remember the password to them and it was so hard just for me to delete them like I had to have a phone number I had to have a PIN number or just something that was just dumb and stupid and wouldn’t just let me delete the accounts. But I successfully deleted them but I’m still having trouble with the sensitivity and I would really appreciated if you would fix it or something because I’ve tried literally everything.

Needs to be tweaked
Twitter is not what it’s cracked up to be. While it is a good site and I enjoyed it as far as the making friends and the camaraderie and discussions. But after only being on the site for almost 3 months. Given her 24 hours Suspension then a one-week suspension for supposedly offensive tweets! Now I have been suspended for four months. Have no idea why. All attempts To get in touch with or communicate with Twitter have been in vain! All I get is the company line we will try to solve this within two or three days although it may take longer. And this is been for four months now! No courtesy of a reason why I was suspended no communication whatsoever! And anything I said on Twitter was not near as bad as some of the Liberals have put on there and still have their accounts. Would really like to have my Twitter account back but something needs to be done with some of the people who are letting their politics influence who is tweets they don’t like and suspend people for!

Glitch in DMs
I got this glitch where it tells me a notification that someone is direct messaging me but when I go there, no one has messaged me and there’s nothing at all. I found a person who messaged me in the request section from my email later on but when I got to my Twitter account, it wasn’t there. So I blocked the person who sent me a message. But the notification in DMs is still there. No one has ever DMed me in the past weeks by now. I logged out and logged in, notification is still there. I deleted the app and reinstalled the app, it didn’t work. I’ve had this glitch notification for over a month or two. This annoyed me so much. It’s only my account that has this glitch, I don’t know to fix it.


Edit: Alright I fixed it. I somehow played around with my settings and turned off quality filter then I finally saw the person’s direct message. Now I gotta remembered how to do it if it happens again.

They don’t care and it shows lol
Like the title says they don’t actually do any work into moderating their site. You might think there’s someone out there reading the tweets that go out but if you search specific slurs you’ll find a myriad of tweets with the n word or f word in them and twitter doesn’t bat an eyelash but get into a discussion with a pedophiliac apologist and tell them they are trash for condoning cp art well then they’re ready to ban or suspend your account. But to be perfectly honest I’m ok being banned from a site that offers a platform to racists, nazis, pedophiles, transphobia, and the absolute cesspool of society. I’m actually glad this has happened and made me realize what a piece of garbage this platform is. It might seem better than the tumblrs of the world and even facebook but is a smidgen better when it comes to social media? Just because it gives the appearance of giving a crap doesn’t mean it does and believe me, Twitter is no different than the facebooks of the world. They would sell you D list celebs selling flat tummy tea but you just have to have targeted ads on. Great service for a dumpster fire I guess...

Opinion is mine.
It’s a lot better than Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Tumbler, Tic-Toc, or anything else. The reason being that Twitter is for the highly intelligent people as philosophers and tweet out their ideas. Scientists can throw out new discoveries in 280 characters or less. There is a wealth of fact accounts which tweet old facts. Bots that do what ever that not was programmed to do. There are many webcomic artists and artists in general. News travels quicker around the country or world. Movie trailers, game trailers, show trailers, et cetra. This was my first social to media to own an account on, and for that reason it will be the most idealistic way to experience it. Trust me I’ve been way more active in my iPhone’s account than my PC’s account. My PC’s account was my original while my iPhone’s account came second. Despite this you shouldn’t need any other social media to experience one like this.

Opinion
I love twitter and have always loved twitter until they updated their rules and policies. they are too strict for my linking now. i’m not understanding how tweeting in bold texts or following/unfollowing too many ppl at once or even tweeting how you feel about a certain political issue can be looked at as a threat. i understand if someone is giving misleading information or threatening someone else but some of their rules just doesn’t make any sense and is uncalled for. Also, i don’t like how you can’t use the same number for multiple accounts. It also says you can in their rules and policies but it won’t let you do it and they need to take that out of their rules so it won’t be misleading. i don’t like having to tweet and then delete my tweets cause i’m overthinking that it’s against twitters rules when it’s not. i respect their rules and policies but i just feel some of them are too strict and not really harmful to be considered a threat.

Bad for my blood pressure
When scrolling down at a certain point it just stops and doesn’t display any more posts. Often a post I tap on disappears or the app will scroll to the top after I tap on the post and I am unable to find that post again. Back-end administration is not even handed and is shrouded in secrecy. For example, blue star “verification” is a joke as many easily verified legitimate sources aren’t verified even though they apply when other accounts favored by those in control get verified immediately. Posts are not handled evenly either. For example, Policies are a joke and are applied unevenly to posts those in control don’t like but not to posts they do like. Terms of Service also seem to be applied unevenly. If enough of a certain group of users complain they will remove or restrict posts and or users based on mob mentality. Certain Chronic violators are allowed to continue on the platform but others are booted off for much lesser infractions and it is usually around political views. If this is a forum for free speech then the powers that be are doing a bad job of it. I’m going to use the Parler app.

Very inconsistent in enforcing their own TOS
I have noticed that “verified accounts”, particularly of those espousing views of the far right, commit all kinds of egregious violations of terms of service, including harassment, threats, hateful conduct, doxxing, and in the case of at least one public official, intimidation of a witness, which is a felony. Yet Twitter allows these accounts to remain as subscribers; but if unknowns, particularly within the progressive community, peacefully express critical comments against even public officials (who should be prepared to accept them as part of their job), those unknowns get their accounts suspended! That double standard, coupled with CEO Jack Dorsey’s meeting with Trump, makes me wonder if he isn’t a Russian asset.


Some of their rules are hard to understand, such as “deboosting”. What Twitter and Facebook need are strong competitors for whom rules really do apply to EVERYONE. For technical support, good luck. It’s almost impossible to get hold of a real person. There’s no phone number to call. Twitter also needs to do a better job of weeding out the bots and troll accounts.

Bias
Twitter is a left wing bias site. I’m Independent and see how bad it has gotten. When will or will it ever be a fair platform? I’m currently on a 3 day limited restriction but have no idea why! I haven’t broken any Twitter rules! I get those captchas asking if I’m a bot but I do everything possible not to do repetitive things just for this reason. I put out some interesting tweets that went a little viral by maybe 1,000 and because I got a lot of followers in a day I go to Twitter jail? Really? I already only follow back so many at a time so I don’t get in trouble but you find a reason anyway and don’t tell me why! I hope one day someone creates a site that is fair to its users. I’m never threatening in any way but Twitter likes to restrict me for no good reason! I mostly just tweet what’s out on another source so why am I in trouble? I’ve seen people threatening on the left but never get in trouble! Hopefully one day someone will come up with a less bias and Constitutional platform. I believe in Free Speech but would never threaten anyone but I see it all the time!

They suspend accounts for no reason
Twitter oh twitter. You have the worst people in your company and those people are radical liberals who think they can silence whoever they want by suspending their account. My account recently got suspended for no reason at all. All I did was respond to a African American woman’s tweet. Mind you that I am also African American. Twitter suspended me because apparently I was being hateful and harassed this person. When obviously I was responding to a situation with a young rapper was charged for a crime and how it’s terrible that youth are on the wrong path to success when it comes to rapping. But because of the word I used which was n***a a word I often used on the platform before my suspension, but because I used it and it was in response to a African American woman. Twitter’s most likely algorithm picked my tweet and most likely thought I was being racist. Twitter you need to think about what you’re doing because you literally just disobeyed the first constitutional right which is free speech. Stop trying to be the good guys and focus on the company and brand. Stop with the obvious social justice warrior nonsense.

Locked out of my account
I love twitter and I’ve had my account for 6 years now, but recently i’ve been locked out of my account. I’ve requested a review about my account 4 days ago which required me to send a photo of my ID, and I’ve yet to get an email back. I sent a request twice and I’m beginning to become really frustrated. I even tried to call Twitter’s number which told me to press 1 for customer support which then proceeded to tell me that they don’t offer customer support over the phone. I don’t understand why you would have the option listed if you don’t offer it? I’ve also tried to message Twitter support off a friend’s account, but it said the DM’s were unavailable. I had given up trying to salvage my old account, so I decided to make a new one with a brand new email address and I WAS LOCKED OUT OF IT for “suspicious activity”. I am extremely aggravated because I can’t even contact anyone to help sort out my problems or make a new account. Like I said, I love Twitter but they need SERIOUS improvement with their customer support. I want my account back!!!

Twitter
I love Twitter because i can see its potential. If the powers that be were not so afraid of it it could blossom into the greatest invention since the printing press. I would have given it five stars except I disagree with some of the unfair censorship. However, it far out does the others by trying to resist the forces thrown at it. I watched a Republican chastise Twitter Rep for not allowing CIA involvement to monitor for Russian disinformation. He also chastised them for not controlling the search result because Alex Jones( this before 2016 election) would show up at the top to often. I don’t watch him but was reminded how Hillary said if elected she would shut him down and Breitbart as they had no right to exist. I was stunned and so I salute Jack for withstanding the pressure, for debating an independent journalist I admire.
I hope he can hold out against immense pressure of his peers.

So far so good
All things considered, Twitter is a magnificent phenomenon. The company seems to have gotten much better about its behavior toward its users. We all knew signing on that it has its rules. We agreed to them. In all fairness however, Twitter has also broken its own rules to the detriment of its guests, and has been a bad actor regarding its bias against profiles that may differ from the political opinions of those who work at twitter. That said, working with limitations often forces us in a good way to refine our thoughts more creatively, and subsequently more clearly. What a great thing for us all to have an outlet for our pain, confusion, humor, love of animals, joys... I’d like to see Milo Yiannopoulous and James Woods be allowed to return, and I’m sure there are others who were unjustly banned or suspended who we would be better to be back with us. Like I said, all things considered :)

FIX THE NOTIFICATIONS!
I used to use this app all day, everyday. It was my go to for just about every piece of news or information that interested me. But somewhere along the way it developed a bug that has driven me to the point of never opening it anymore. If you open the app it almost immediately tells you that you have a message. When you tap on the messages tab there is nothing there and the notification goes away. But if you then close the app, there is now a red bubble notification on the badge. Open the app again to see what it is and once again it says you have a message. And there’s nothing there!!! For someone with mild clinical OCD this is absolutely maddening. It’s to the point now where I won’t open the app at all.

The iPad App Bites!
The iPad version is horrible compared to the iPhone version, thus why I am only giving the Twitter app a 2 star rating. I don’t care for the forced viewing of the Trends on the right side of the screen, especially since the trends are by no means close to my interests. I have tried to customize my trends, but all I can do is choose a city, with the closest to my location being Denver, which pretty much only shows sports, or I can let the Twitter AI choose what it believes my interest are, which pretty much is only sports. The problem is that I HATE most sports and most of the people I follow have nothing to do with sports. If there was a way to turn off the trends completely or have the option to actually select the trends I am interested in, I may give the app a higher rating, but until then it stays at 2. (And yes, I have gone in to my Twitter data and updated my interests, but it doesn’t do anything and when I go back in a week later, the AI has added items back that I have removed.)

Enjoyable
I love the content and have many interactions with old friends and new friends on Twitter. However, i only give 4 stars because of the random technical difficulties I have with twitter. One being i can rarely open the drafts folder, sometimes it works other times (seemingly the important times) it will freeze loading drafts and the app will crash or ill have to reopen the app, to which drafts is still unusable. Also the video player has issues. Sometimes it freezes. Earlier today it continually paused the video on its own instantly after i would touch play it would pause. Eventually like an hour later i tried again and the video played. I’ve had other issues with the video player. Overall i enjoy twitter those small technical difficulties being my main problems.

The best social media app. Hands down.
Twitter is the perfect social media website to, expresses yourself and connect with everyone around the globe. You can chat with your local friends, stay on top of the latest trends and news. Even tweet directly to your favorite celebrity, corporation, ANYONE (with an account) !! The best part is you’re not be required to share in depth information about yourself. You can describe your life more in your bio, or don’t! There is also a location option, I personally have “work” in mine, but you can use any city in the world, or just wherever you want for that matter. You can share pictures and videos with whomever, or follow funny accounts and share the latest memes. You can always stay up to date on your favorite movies and music. Follow a dog or a cartoon, there’s endless possibilities!!

Too many politically motivated accounts pulled
You have to be kidding about pulling Senator McConnells account. Too many examples of verbal violence promotion by liberals and politicians that face no reprise from Twitter. The distorted liberal diatribe is what inflamed and divides and then you eventually have conservatives challenging their ridiculous lies that are posted every minute. The lies are based on lies and conservative voices can only try to address. Democrats have been the narrow minded ones working to take Rights of others away since the days they ran the Klu Klux Klan and now they are trying to reduce our 1st, 2nd, and 4th Amendment Rights on an ongoing basis. Why is this smart? Once they are gone we become Khmer Rouge, China, Cuba, Venezuela, and Russia. Our current rights and freedoms are what make us the envy of the world. Ask all of those who want to come here from other countries. They know.

Needs More Characters
If you use Twitter for more than just retweeting and liking other people’s tweets- I’m sure you have come across the hindering effect that the very short character count has on unverified accounts. Tweeting with links to articles and such can be quite challenging due to the limitations of the character count.


Spaces, characters in the links you are pasting to the tweet, and people you are tagging should absolutely NOT be included in the total character count; this just takes away from the ability to include important information in the tweet itself.


This is an incredibly user-friendly app that allows for countless abilities to connect with other people- that is why I am giving it 4 stars, because other than the fact that blank spaces and characters contained in links count as total characters affected by the limitations, this app is perfect.

Perfect example of communist style censorship
Such a large platform which hides behind the statement of being a platform for free speech, yet acts like a publisher censoring everything that doesn’t fit with the CEO and employees narrow anti American viewpoint. Twitter will slap a fact check banner across your post half the time using a fact that has nothing to do with your post, only that it doesn’t align withTwitter’s political viewpoint. If you’re lucky, you will fly under the radar of the cancel culture employees who will gleefully delete your profile for no other reason than that you hold conservative values. They have been seen on camera openly bragging about this. Take a look at how the CEO speaks to Senators when they are questioning him as they are trying to investigate as to whether Twitter is censoring people. One minute he speaks arrogantly as if he is above them while the next, he acts like he doesn’t understand simple yes no questions.


If you really wish to support a company such as this, be my guest, but users are leaving in droves and you will probably be alone.

Great App
I’ve been using Twitter since it first came out and I was so amazed at house much I could learn about what’s going on around the world in real time. It was a game changer back then and it still is now. Every social platform has bugs from time to time, ALL of them. That’s just how technology works. But I’ll say Twitter has the best response time in regards to anything, not limited to fixing bugs in such a quick manner. It’s also the only social media platform that TRULY allows you free speech. They don’t take down offensive posts nearly as often as Instagram and Facebook, only if they cross a verrrryyyyy big line. Not saying that’s the type of Tweeter I am, I am all for equality and Twitter also has one of the most diverse users. Long story short ?????? give this a try, it’s not what you’re used to, but it’s equally as awesome. ??????

When you decide to let ME control MY timeline I'll start using your app again, until then I'll be using a different app. I hate the "In case you missed it", and I don't want too see what everyone else likes, if I want to see that, I'll look at their profile. The most important thing, stop automatically scrolling to the top of my timeline. You're trying to be too much like Facebook, I don't use it for all of these reason. Please give me control of my timeline. Why is it so hard to simply show me things in chronological order?


Update: while they have stopped automatically scrolling my timeline to the top, I don’t want to see what everyone else likes in my timeline. I also would prefer it to just show everything in chronological order vs me seeing “in case you missed it”
It really can’t be that hard to at least give us options for this stuff. Until all this is fixed, I’ll continue using an alternate app, and Twitter will loose its add money.

A feature I would love to see added...
Great application. I use it a lot for personal & also professional usage. As part of my work, I make extensive usage of the list features. I have few public, and servers curated private lists to keep up with different information flows. I would love to see the ability to with the click of a button or setting...turn on/off push notifications for a particular public or private list or lists of users. This would allow me to disable notifications from a number of accounts on my off days when I don’t need to be connected as much, but also give the ability to quickly turn on a list when I head back in to work or am working from home. I don’t know if anyone has ever requested this feature, but I sure would love to see it. Again, great application. Definitely my top social media choice.

Likes and dislikes
As a millennial having been born in the early 80’s I have the viewpoint from a world originally without the broad connection of the internet. To see the world become so connected and so much smaller and more convenient is like watching the planet mature right in front of my eyes; It’s breathtaking.


Apps like Twitter give everyone a podium to design as your own with which to stand upon and as followers increase your crowd becomes larger, but your also part of others crowd. Anything important to you, anything that drives your life and fuels your heart, can be shared or supported from your couch. This positive greatly outweighs most negatives which are usually the fault of the human condition.


We all have to let each other have a podium even if we disagree and that is a challenge, but good too, because otherwise you wouldn’t even know who to disagree with. My only real personal issue other than the nastiness of some due to human condition is the fact that it’s hard to hit that like button when I don’t necessarily agree with the tweet. I am still missing those reaction buttons from Facebook letting anyone know whether I am happy or sad or angry about the information I am subjected to and a similar format would be great.


Still those small issues don’t outweigh the connection and platform for me and I would love to see the whole world of people so close. Thank you!

Rebuilding requires all hands on deck
A little bird told me that one day I would be part of a military operation with a mission to save lives and rebuild communities rather than end them.


A rare message coming from a Navy Veteran who started as a deck seaman that went to sea for the first night during a hurricane, spent 6 months in the Straight of Hormuz baby sitting oil tankers and witnessed what we spend our blood a treasure on that serves no benefit here at home or defends the constitution in anyway to solves the political problems that prevent us from preventing the preventable like a plague of fear and greed.


I eventually become a Corpsman/Surgical Technician / and A leader in The Rapid Deployable Medical Teams before getting out in Oakland, Ca just in time for the earthquake, fires and drug wars in the late 80-90s.


30 years later, that little birdie was right!


For the last 8 years I’ve been helping fellow veterans respond to disasters and then stay to help some of the most disadvantaged families rebuild their homes.


Your service has made our job easier to get the message out that not all veterans are waving their guns around in times of a pandemic, nation political crisis, or after repeated and massive hurricane destruction. #TeamRubicon

The Twitter App Works Well
As an old-timer I find the app easy to use and understand. The medium is controversial, but the software is excellent on iPhone and very seldom do I encounter problems. Twitter can be a source for major breaking news, and my feed includes winners of Pulitzers, a Nobel or two, and a gaggle of intelligent, encouraging followers. There are little tricks you have to learn, especially if you need more characters; but that also makes you a better editor and a more concise writer. The problems with bots, fake accounts, flaming, and such date back to the old days of Compuserve, Prodigy, and AOL, so that’s not new. However, the corporate titans should stop the flow of disinformation from hostile and malignant sources, if only we could figure out how. Again, I highly recommend the app as easy to learn and easy to use. Cheers - T????

Differences of Opinion
Almost scored Twitter with 3 stars and have considered not using twitter at all due to the exaggerated negativity, foul and hateful language from some individuals who choose to follow some of the same people I do. Everyone should calm down and express differences of opinion and/or facts in a manner that encourages constructive two-way dialogue. That’s part of growing as a person.


Mutual respect for one another will make a difference in influencing others. It’s ok to embrace our differences in our thoughts, beliefs and convictions. No one is wrong, just independent. After all, we are Americans! Use the power of your vote to make a difference!


It’s not necessary to invade, threaten or harm one another for any reason and anytime. Let’s respect each other’s boundaries and not dismiss one another with such rancor and hate. A kind word , or no word at all, may be a better way to influence one another.

More characters
The website needs more characters to clearly communicate a message. Twitter is a place for conversation now and not always just a short message where you have to rearrange your word choices and cut words out or you make a tweet and it’s just a character or two over. It’s annoying and also needs an edit button. I like the minimalist user interface but don’t like the suppression of free speech and the political censorship is irresponsible and an awful business practice especially for a company the magnitude of Twitter. Jack I hope you see this and stop letting your company boss you around. It’s like you can’t even speak anything meaningful on the platform you created. I’d like to hear more from you and also hear your thoughts on why Twitter has grown increasingly draconian and censors. Censorship has created a toxic and biased culture of racists and name calling. There’s so much more potential for Twitter but it’s only a matter of time before it’s irrelevant. I’d rather not see it go that way and would love to see twitter improve. Bless.

Was better in the beginning but now has devolved.
At first I only got Twitter to see what was going on in the world. Through it I got to meet new people and have interesting conversations. All was well, then Everything started getting political and thuggish. People started bashing others simply for having different opinions, people were calling others racist because they didn’t support certain factions or ideals. I was even harassed simply for defending my ideals. I didn’t mean any harm to others, I didn’t call for someone’s death, I only fought for my freedom to speak my mind even if most disagreed with it. Twitter itself did Nothing to defend me or others in my place. It has proven to be biased time and time again to catering to the mob and backing issues that are clearly against its own guidelines. Twitter and other Social Media has become incredibly polluted with hatred, death, and lies. I will no longer support this media and others like it. Having other opinions is fine and any disagreements can be discussed with civility and respect. There is none of it here.

Good concept ruined by toxic community
I like the concept of micro-blogging and how it allows you to share posts, articles, and images. However, the community removes the enjoyment of all that. The endless line of harassment, racism, and hatred that I have experienced on the app genuinely makes me mad to the point where I cannot enjoy browsing Twitter anymore. Categories such as politics, sports, fandoms, and even memes of all things are just followed up by pointless arguments and bullying. I’m constantly reporting all these accounts that harass others, but I’m not even sure if reporting works, because Twitter doesn’t update me on whether or not they violated their terms. The amount of misinformation spread by users in politics and other categories is also dangerous to the point where they actually reach the trending page. Even the President of the U.S. is using Twitter as a form of propaganda. If you really need to interact with others and use social media like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, be my guest, but if you want to keep your mental health in check, steer clear.

Love it...though
Update: I’ve always loved this app. Now. Few things....I want the profile button back at the bottom. I want access to my profile page as well as my lists with one hit of the button not five. Second. Trending. I don’t want things in my trending to be completely local. Or completely national. Why? Bc it’s not always relevant. A few tweets about something local... is neither trending news nor unusual...we know there's a hawks game....okay? Nor (I guess third and lastly) do I want meaningless fluff. Like moments of celebs. That’s not news either.


First review: I'd like better filtering especially for all political words please ;) Also a big deal for me...is the hoops I’ve got to jump through just to get back to my profile. It’s my most used key. I’d like it back on the bottom dashboard. It’s ridiculous that it is so many back pages away to get to my main page. Definitely impedes my experience.

Internal problems
I had finally gotten the Twitter app after years of not having it and hours after I downloaded and started my account I am locked out. I thought reasonably and decided that it must have been for security purposes. I go to start the steps to get back into my account and all that pops up is a plain white screen with the words “Are you a robot?” writer at the top. There are no arrows no next buttons just these words and a blank screen. I have tried restarting my phone, nothing happened. I have tired to re-download the app, nothing happened. This is especially frustrating because I had just started this account and therefore do not understand the root of my problem. I am wondering if this is a glitch or something else that is not my fault.

Twitter: A love/hate relationship
Twitter is such an immersive app, whether you have a good or bad experience on the app, you can’t help but become a part of the experience. I definitely love this app, the global blog aspect that it has, keeps you coming back. Twitter is also a place where you can find news, social communities, and even follow( and sometimes even interact with) your favorite celebrities. The good aspects of Twitter heavily outweigh the bad; in my opinion. But on it’s bad days, Twitter can become very toxic. Opinions on this app can sometimes be misconstrued as fact, so when operating this app, be sure to have your facts together. Other than that, the app can sometimes become home, the level of immersion is unmatched by any other app; combining the great aspects of most of the other great social media apps around.

Not able to resolve suspended accout
I’m an author. I made some accounts for characters from my book, and had them interact with each other in humorous twitter skits. Once, I was suspended temporarily (on my main account. My own fault-perfectly okay with that.) But my character accounts were suspended. I acknowledge that I had too many, too many company identities, one for publishing, one for production, etc. However, I reached out to support to try and resolve the issue, but they never followed up with me. The character accounts in question were always polite and affable to the people they interacted with, and had distinct personalities. I would have gladly given up some of the more superfluous accounts to save the more important ones. My inability to reach reach a human being left me very dissatisfied. I stay on it mainly to follow politics, but that is very depressing, given how the presiden abuses his account to spread dishonest propaganda.

What Happened To Twitter?
This app used to be a staple for news and content. Unfortunately it’s now a hardcore censorship engine that evolved the app into a propaganda machine for specific political points of view pushed by Twitter Corporate Office. They’ve watered down the Timeline, show popular recommended Tweets instead of Latest Tweets, they have partisan Trending News only showing terrible things about the United States President, constantly (who would allow such a thing other than foreign enemies of the USA), and the settings now filter content on a second level (hidden) which you have to shut-off to see your preferred content (outrageous).. All trending news is always slanted to favor One political party promoted also by the Twitter CEO daily. News corporations, who even claim alien spaceship parts are in Las Vegas (2017 NY Times) are given priority over citizens to ensure the broadest brainwashing of political propaganda with an emphasis on hating the United States President. Who remembers when the internet was a melting pot of diversity? Freedom of speech? Not so much anymore. Great work Twitter!

Dictation needs to be fixed badly.
So before this recent update of the Twitter app for iOS, everything was working fine. Dictation was one of those things. Now, it seems that if you are visually impaired or not, you have to write out what you want to say unless you can do short hand. Even if I turn voiceover off, dictation still doesn’t work. I start to dictate what I want to say and then dictation turns itself off. I have called Apple about this issue, and Apple says that it’s not their issue. Which in fairness it’s not. Because dictation works everywhere else. I have even uninstalled the application, turned off the phone, turned on the phone again, and then went to re-download the app. I even signed in with my credentials and tried to dictate a test tweet. That didn’t work. Please fix this annoying bug for those who have visual impairments or different handicapped problems and also for those who have no visual issues whatsoever. I can’t even send support help questions because they do not get back to me.

Could use improvements
I would like to be able to search through my followers by name to easily filter through as well as search on other people’s pages through their followers too. For business/giveaway purposes it makes things so much easier! Another BIG thing that is a safety issue....I absolutely hate when you block someone and that person tries to search for you and your profile still pops up but the page says “this person has blocked you”. I don’t want them seeing that I’ve blocked them due to safety reasons. Better that my name doesn’t pop up at all when they try to search for me after being blocked.


Other than that this is a great app/platform and great way to reach out to people. I’ve started a new career and met amazing people because of this app. Thank you for changing my life, Twitter.

Worse all the time
A truly awful application that they keep managing to make worse in large and small ways. Kudos on the innovation required to make even the display of “likes” into the visual equivalent of a hovering mosquito! Twitter has one useful function — displaying short, timely posts of a selected group of people in chronological order — and they have been trying to destroy that one function for years. With the latest round of updates, I think they’ve finally done it. Their concept of “home,” showing random posts by random people in random order, reveals the developer’s true goal: chaos. They want nothing less than the destruction of order itself, and to make their point clear, they shuffle the posts *while you are reading them*. The only reasons I can see that twitter still exists is 1) it is the chosen platform of a raving would-be dictator, and 2) “at least it’s not Facebook. Will their striving for chaos finally overcome the network effect, erasing them from our lives and memories? We can only hope.

Trust and the police?
At 30 I was beaten up by a boyfriend. He took creak, I did not not take drugs. He would drag me down stairs, abuse me, I had bruises all over my body.
He call the police high on creak. The police decided to arrest me after taking pictures of the bruised all over my body. I was placed in solitary confinement for 8 day.
I was bleeding heavily. A officer of the jail told me I had a tubal pregnancy. They wanted me to go to a jail hospital. I said no I am innocent. How do the police think they are. Definitely not defend and protecting.


Understand I was staying at a motel witch I could not afford anywhere night night- the jerk of a police man arrested me and my boyfriend for being intoxicated in public. My boyfriend was beaten up where the kept the car- I was realized- to the rotten police who do you think you are- above the law.

Nice app but could be way better
I like Twitter for the people on the platform and as a source for curated content. .The app, while functional, is confusing. A lot of this boils down to the UX. The ux elements are crammed together - perhaps to show more rows of content. The end result is it’s not clear where to tap to do actions vs view them. For e.g, It’s not clear where to tap to view replies vs enter a reply. Same with Likes. Fb does a much better job of this by having separation in the ux for these two. Finally, with posts with links - why not show a preview? Right now I don’t know what the link contains or if it send me to some malicious site. Finally it’s not clear how to view topics by interests. Also for advanced features like moments, and lists - I have no idea what they are for and how to use them - make it clear. Getting these basics right will go a long way in making the site more useful for non power users.

Won’t open up on correct tweet
I’m sure all phones have this option, to open a tweet up from your notification on your lock screen! Well when I tap to open a specific tweet on one of my top followers, it doesn’t open to their tweet, but to my account messages! And then I have to go search their name and scroll through “tweets and likes” until I find the tweet, and most of the time they tweeted again by this time! I’ve tried every setting, I tried not closing out Twitter. Once in a while it works but mostly not! Also another highly frustrating problem is I only have notifications for all tweets turned on for maybe 5 people, but I do not get these notifications for some reason and these are very important to me!! Any ideas, anyone?
