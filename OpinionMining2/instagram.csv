I appreciate the quick responses and corrections for the issues Iíve had. Thank you. Iím very new to the business side of Insta, so Iím not very fluent in the algorithms and how they work. I donít quite understand how to obtain followers. I donít like that my profile seems to be categorized with other dog stores which is pointless, because other stores arenít potential customers. My profile keeps getting tagged with inappropriate pictures, since my profile is linked to the website they upload there too. Iíve changed my settings to prevent that now but somehow they are still there in the background as if they are used to place my profile into a spam server or something, idk. It seems like posts donít circulate unless you pay, especially on Facebook. Plus paying only gets you false likes, the analytics show down to the millisecond how much time was spent on the site, what page, what products etc. I feel like the clicks are computer generated and arenít real potential customers. My profile lost 100 followers overnight it seems and now for every follower I get I lose the same number. Although I appreciate the followers I do have, it seems they are from countries in which I donít sell products, so again pointless. How do I generate followers? How do I prevent the inappropriate tagging? How do I keep my profile from being spammed? What am I missing?
Instagram has made it even harder for you to see posts from the people that you actually follow with this most recent update. I now only see about 10 - 12 photos from people I actually follow, before I get to the ìyouíve been caught upî message & suggested posts start popping up. I follow 200+ people, 80% of whom update regularly, yet instagram is making it impossible to see them. I miss so much time sensitive information, including sales, events or donations, all because instagram has moved explore page posts to your home feed as well. And posts are being BURIED with this new update. Half the time the ìnewî posts on my timeline are 1-2 weeks old & the posts in my ìolderî tab are from the same day. As a creator myself, my engagement has dropped exponentially, as Instagram is making it increasingly difficult for my work, & the work of others, to be seen.
Instagram is a great app to use on your free time and to connect with other people. This is why I was really interested in using Instagram to try and help out my barber career. The one annoying issue Iím having is when it comes to trying to add an action button for booking. I have tried this with three different booking apps so far and with no luck. For example I am trying to add my square appointments app as a book option on my business account. The videos I have seen about how to do this, show that once you click on the app you use to schedule your clients, you need to enter in the URL that will link them to your booking page. I believe this is where the problem is. Instagram doesnít give me an option to enter a URL. The order that Instagram sends me is ( connect website > please select business to connect > connect to Instagram > connection successful). Then when I refresh my page there is no action button. I have used three different booking apps in hopes that one of them would work and none of them do. I have the online booking option turned on within the app as well and it still doesnít work. Itís extremely frustrating and to add onto it, I canít find anywhere online to help me. Thereís no way to contact Instagram, at least from what I have seen and it feels like itís never going to work for me. This app could easily be a 5 star, but this one problem is really making it hard.
Instagram has made it even harder for you to see posts from the people that you actually follow with this most recent update. I now only see about 10
And that's not to mention the horrific placement of the new reels tab, dead in the center of the app, with the new shop page directly right, kicking both the post button & the notifications tab to the top of the screen on the home page. As a small business, this is FRUSTRATING to say the least. It seems like instagram is hell bent on punishing the very people that keep their app alive. At the very least, give people the autonomy to organize their app tabs the way they want to & choose to have a chronological home feed or an algorithmic based one. Come on Instagram, lets do better.
Good app
I like Instagram. I do. Itís a good app for keeping in contact with friends and for being able to share the things I create as an artist. But I swear the app gets worse with every update. The changes to the layout of the home page that make it so itís basically a second explore page and so you donít see posts from those you follow in chronological order are frustrating. The change to messages that make it so swiping prompts a reply to someone rather than exiting is confusing and non-intuitive, not to mention outright useless. The changes to the placement of the notification and posting tabs are infuriating. This is an app for sharing, not for shopping. Keep the shopping tab out of the main tab bar and put reels back with explore.
Instagram would be much more user friendly if there was an option to toggle certain features (although calling them features instead of ìhinderancesî might, in some cases, be generous), such as the swipe-to-reply in messages, the suggested posts after the most recent posts in the home section, or whether posts were ordered algorithmically or chronologically. Additionally, allowing users to set up the layout of their tab bar would also make it more user friendly. Iím sure someone out there prefers the easy access to the reels tab, and would want to keep it where it currently is. But most donít. Thus, allowing users to choose which features show up on the bar would make the app far better.
I love this app so much. I use it every single day, and use it to keep in contact with my friends. It is very easy to post things, direct messages work well, and stories are a neat feature even if it wasnít an original idea.
Although there are many impressive features on this app, I am not sure if I like the new comment section where you can see the top liked comments first and not the most recent ones. I feel like I miss out on everything that Instagram doesnít deem important.
"I have pretty much the same comments as everyone else, regarding bringing back chronological order of the feed, stories being a ripoff of Snapchat (but I believe Facebook, instagram, and Snapchat are all owned by the same company if Iím not mistaken), etc. BUT ALSO, I just bought an iPhone X and the app needs some serious revamping be compatible with the new phone. They did a good job of having the layout fill the full screen view of the X; HOWEVER, when you go to upload a new profile photo, if you click on any photo besides the very most recent one in your photo album, the layout glitches, and the ìCancelî and ìDoneî buttons move up on top of the iPhoneís time and battery displays. I wish I could attach a photo to this review, but I hope my explanation makes sense. This glitch makes it impossible to click either of the buttons, and you have to physically kill the app and reopen it in order to get out of the screen and back to using the app. This happens every time you try to change the profile photo. If you use the most recent photo in your album, it works mostly fine, with just a little "
"Overall, Instagram is an excellent social media app. However, I have found a few flaws in the way Instagram looks. For example, the comments are not in chronological order;making them very confusing. I have found a similar problem in the feed algorithm. They are not in chronological order anymore. You will see a post from 2 weeks ago, and then a post from 2 DAYS ago. Next, there should be a bigger time frame for videos. You cab only have a video that is 1 minute long. I wanted to post a slime review, but the video was 2 minutes long so I had to do it in 2 separate videos even though all of the slimes came together. Finally, I think you should fix the messages. You can always see if someone has seen your direct message. This isn't exactly a problem, but I think there should be an option, in case someone does not want people to know when they have seen their messages. Please take these suggestions into consideration. I know I am not the only person complaining about these things. Other than those problems, I have only had good experiences with Instagram. It is very easy and fun to use. You can share pictures and videos with your community or even the world! All in all, Instagram is a fantastic app, but needs a few fixes."
I only had the opportunity to use Instagram for a week, and I spent that time following people I know, businesses Iíve worked for, museums, galleries, and shops Iíve been to, or hoped to spend time, and money with, and I watched a lot of hilarious, and fun videos. Then, Instagram locked me out of my account, and told me I had violated the user agreement by somehow hiring someone to do all that for me! What? I wouldnít even know how to begin to do that. I ëheartedí videos, and posts that I liked. I followed people, places, and causes of interest to me. Iíd hoped to switch over to a professional account, and point an arrow from Instagram to another site to sell my artwork, but by the time I was able to log back on Instagram(About 45 minutes) they had deleted all my saved links, and content from the past week! They never emailed or messaged me- they just did it! I deleted the account account after that- unprofessional! If Iíd been posting things, and theyíd suspended the account I would have understood, but I hadnít even made my first post for them to judge what I might have to post or say! Unprofessional, anti-intellectual, and frankly they wasted my time. Iíll spend my time, and resources elsewhere, Instagram. Lesson learned.
Seeing what my friends like is 80% of what I use this for. This has been my main social media, and was my favorite up until this new year. Probably moving to something else. How can people be so out of touch. Youíve slowly destroyed this app over the past few months. Iím not sure if Facebook bought you out but it sure seems like it. This was a place you could really laugh with your friends and meet new people. But why not be snapchat? Why not be Facebook? There popular right? This isnít just about this recent update, youíve been deactivating ìmemeî pages for months and thereís a reason they get so many likes and followers. Because we enjoy them. I donít plan to be with you much longer. Maybe give us a useful function thatís not something snap already has, or just keep taking key features of your app out thatís a good course of action. Maybe if people want to hide all the ìig modelsî they like you can add a setting to hide just YOUR stuff from your followers ìfollowing activityî. The only logical reasoning is people want to hide what they like, give them the option to do that on there own. This seems to be in favor of the ig models, now all these new people can like because there wives/whoever wonít see. And we all lose a way of seeing things people with similar interests like. Nobody wants to watch explore tiktoks, models, nba videos. Iím interested in more than what you feel like is ìtrendingî
The new update is absolutely annoying. I canít see recent posts without having to click on older posts from people I follow. And if I donít click on that it just displays ONE new picture from someone I follow. Every time I get on this app all I see is that. Which at this point has gotten on my nerves. Just that one recent picture which is 7 hours old now. Even if I refresh the page I donít get an update of recent posts with other people I follow. Before the new update it changes constantly and I know some people that I do follow post on a daily basic. Change the format back. I rather scroll on my feed to see post of people I FOLLOW. Not the stupid suggest posts on my feeds. Change it back to how it was. This is incredibly stupid. Itís more stupid having another button to see older posts on my personal page. Stop putting explore page videos/posts of people I do not follow on the personal page. I get on Instagram multiple times a day and I do use the explore page a lot. Keep the personal page separate from the explore page. That is beyond ridiculous. Why are you changing the format? I donít want to see suggested posts on my personal page. Change it back to where when I scroll on my personal page, it just displays posts from people I follow. Stop including the explore 
I can never say that an instagram update has ever thrilled me in recent years. Every single time this app has a massive overhaul, the controls become even more clunky and jammed together, I donít even know what itís trying to be anymore. Iíve been on this app for 7 years. In those 7 years, the notification/activity tab has been in the right corner, just left of the account button. So it baffles me as to why someone would feel the need to move it to the most unconventional place possible. It is so terribly out of the way now, and not only that, itís been replaced with a shopping button, so every time my dumb ADHD self goes to check my notifications, Iím sent to some bootleg Wish page. To whichever one of you working at instagram decided to cram the activity button into the top corner with 2 other tabs, I truly hope you have an awful day. Just an unpleasant time. I hope you get a parking ticket, and your car runs out of gas. And you go to the kitchen to find your spouse has tried a new recipe for dinner, and itís just not very good. And your computer crashes at a very inconvenient time, and you were using an adobe product and forgot to save recently, so you lose a lot of progress on whatever garbage your team concocted to ruin the experience of your user base. I truly
Good social media app, bad user interface design
I never bothered to leave any reviews because I did not really have any issues with the app until now. Please REMOVE the annoying notifications of ìpeople you may knowî. I find notifications about people I may know extremely annoying and unnecessary. I donít care about people I may know. I didnít mind seeing the suggested people on the app but now Iím getting actual notifications about this and itís really annoying. Itís always people I donít know at all and there is no way to turn off these stupid notifications. I hate them, please remove these awful notifications or at least give us the option to turn them off because when I went to check to see if I can turn off this specific notification, there was no option to do so. The only notifications Iím interested in are notifications of likes and comments on my posts and when my friends send me direct messages and friend requests. Any other notifications Iím not interested in, but the other notifications at least have an option to turn them off. But these people you may know notifications are just annoying, useless and I have no option to turn them off. Please give us that option to turn these notifications off as I DO NOT want them! Iíll raise the number of stars once you provide the option to get rid of that annoying notification of people I may know.
I was just on an NFL post about the Jaguars defensive stats having a plain old argument that even though the Steeleís lost that doesnít make the Jags a better team... that has nothing to do with my problem. The problem is I typed a response to a commenter during the argument of which I was blocked from posting saying that Instagram keeps certain ìguidelinesî for the community... some generic message Iíd expect if i was trying to say something racist or sexist. But no. It was a simple argument about football that I was blocked from expressing my opinion on because it didnít follow ìguidelinesî. The comment had no vulgar language and presented my argument in such a way that there was no degrading or demeaning connotation toward the would be recipient. TAKE NOTE: This comment was made on an NFL post and I was blocked from posting my opinion AGAINST the team the post was promoting. This is not a singular or first occurrence as Iíve had this problem before with Instagram blocking me from posting comments that oppose the view(s) expresses within the correlating post. I quite frankly find this ridiculous amongst the sea of comments I read through on posts from news publications such as Fox. As long as you donít disagree with the post you can same just about anything that isnít immediately racist or sexist... but I canít argue about football. Fix this.
Iíve been an Instagram user for a long time now and I really enjoy the app. Definitely my favorite social media platform. I, unlike most, really like Instagram stories and I love how you can save stuff without having to screenshot. My complaint however is my home feed. Iím tired of only seeing posts from 5 of the 200 people I follow. I wish there was a way to have it be in chronological order, but you can make it so that specific people do show up at the top of your feed. This may sound a little silly but itís pretty embarrassing when you accidentally like and comment on a post from 5 days ago as if it was posted ten minutes ago. Really I donít understand why Instagram is making all these frankly useless updates to the algorithm. Instead of that they should be cracking down on how the thumbnail (starter photo?) for a video has nothing to do with the video. Now thatís something that needs worked on. I feel that these algorithm changes only benefit the people exploiting Instagram and hurts regular users content intake. This is a little long so in short great app but please stop messing with my feed, or at least give me the option to change it back to the way it was if I so please.
I really enjoy using Instagram but I have one issue and that is that when I try to upload more than one photo into one post it crops my photos to the same size as the first one in the post. I want to be able to post all of them into one post and have all of the pictures be the original size. This would be great for photographers like me who go out on photoshoots and want to put up one post with their best photos. It is hard to do that when all of your photos are cropped the exact same way. It should be the same way as Facebook. I am not saying we make Instagram exactly like Facebook because they are two different social medias, but I think it would be nice if we could upload photos on Instagram the same way we can upload them on Facebook. With Facebook you have one post with multiple pictures that are all the original sizes. You can then click on them and look through them individually before exiting and going through the rest of your feed. Instagram should allow us to have the option to upload our photos like this. We should have an option to do this If we have a photography account. I know not everyone would want to upload their photos this way but many would choose to do this.
So I seriously like this app and following creators but I have a problem with how my feed is always set up. First of all, my feed is not in chronological order! The way itís set up is very very unnecessary, I miss many posts from the accounts I follow! I also end up seeing posts from the second they upload a photo to the next post being from another person from 5 days ago! Second, since the way our feed is set up it keeps changing the posts every single time I come back to the app, again with the same thing, a post from 5 days ago to like 3 minutes ago. Like youíre lucky to catch one thatís very recent. Thatís just so uncomfortable and very annoying. Please bring back chronological order or have an option for this!!(I seriously believe having an option is perfect!! It gives us a choice!!) Itís more helpful than accidentally missing a post because the way this is set up. Or completely miss a whole week of posts by someone. Anyways We have been trying to ask you guys for so long now! Itís certainly something we need back.
So I went to go on my art account right. I go to check my activity and it says ìweíre having trouble accessing your activityî and I was like ok maybe I need to refresh it. I did and nothing changed. So then I say ok Iím just going to post another piece of artwork when I go to post it, it wouldnít post. I also tried refreshing it. It didnít post. Eventually I was like ok maybe itís my email. I went to go confirm my email and bam! Could not confirm my email I retried over and over again and nothing changed. I even tried turning my phone off and back on again even though I just got this iPhone 8 in December! When I tried it again after restarting my phone, it still didnít work. So eventually I was like ok you know what, let me just log out and log back in.
I am finding it harder to use Instagram with every update. Changes that are being made are unnecessary and feel unnatural to me. I canít see posts in chronological order, I have ìsuggestionsî on the feed which I go to see ONLY what the people Iím following have been up to. Thatís been slightly annoying, but now in the explore feed when I click on one post with the intention to scroll through all the posts suggested to me from various users... instead Iím met with only one users posts, most of which Iím not interested in and itís annoying to have to go back and click the next picture to see the next meme or what-have-it, causing me to close the app and open FaceBook or Twitter instead as they arenít making changes that are majorly affecting the way users browse content. I donít know who instagram has put in charge of these updates, but every single update gets worse. ALSO not to mention, the app will automatically follow accounts that I have either never encountered or had no interest in following. I have never left a review in the AppStore but Instagram used to be my favorite social media outlet and now Iím much more fond of other things due to some of the updates and I think a lot of people might feel this way about the path instagram is taking.
My Instagram feed is now filled with posts from advertisers and accounts of which I donít even follow. I never see my friends on my feed anymore unless I am scrolling for 10 minutes and peopleís pictures are not getting as many likes. I can speak from experience because I have watched my likes go down as Instagram has changed their algorithm. People like things which are unique! Keep Instagram different and unique and make other platforms want to be like you, not you wanting to be like them. If the changes are based off of Statistics, realize the functions of other apps. Snapchat for instance, people like it simply because it is very private. On Instagram you are able to send pictures to people however they can be uploaded from the camera roll and used to look like the picture was taken just then.. this makes Instagram very user friendly for catfishes. Just keep the traditional Instagram aspects and forget about conformity. Make it so dm pictures- if uploaded from camera roll, it states that. Additionally, make the feed tendered to followers which a users look at most frequently.
Made a great account and was gaining a lot of followers but only ended up having it for 6 days because Instagram banned it. I had 600 hundred followers and was averaging 100 followers gained a day. The first thing they did to my account was make it unable to comment but that was understandable I guess because I was commenting a lot. They then lifted this after one day. I started posting again and realized my hashtags didnít work because now they shadow banned me because (and Iím guessing) they believed my account was a bot. This got me mad but my account was still thriving so I did not care. They than started deleting some of my post claiming it went against their guidelines which I read later on and saw that it didnít.i also made a promotion with one of my vids and had no problems and the next time I tried doing it with the same vid They said it went against there ad policy. 
I love Instagram, itís like a more modern version of Facebook thats basic enough for my grandma to understand but still fun for me to use. However I donít know if this is a fluke or apart of the update. A message came up saying Instagram limits how much likes we can do on comments at a time to stop bullying... I just want to know who thought this was a good idea. This is a social media app thatís like the whole point, liking is literally the foundation of every media. If you have a limit whether your intentions are bad or not your going to end up being wiped for existence. And also I donít know who thought a limit on liking comments would prevent bullying but that person has 
great app, some changes would be amazing
Instagram is a great app that I use on a daily basis, I love it and iíve had it multiple years, but there are some changes that would make this app go above and beyond that me, and many others, would appreciate. First off, after you post multiple pictures in one post, you should be able to delete some pictures out of the post without having to delete the whole post. This would make so many users more happy because there are countless times when you accidentally post one picture in a group of pictures that you donít like, but you didnít realize it in time and you already have many likes and comments so you donít want to delete the whole post and you just stay stuck on what to do. Also, if you creators made a way to preview certain pictures on a private account that the creator of the account puts up that would be amazing! Itís difficult to tell who some people are sometimes when you are only able see their profile pic so if you were able to select a few pictures from camera roll to put up (no likes or comments involved) it would be a huge help.
Iíve had instagram since I can honestly remember and Iíve always loved it. But recently I have started an art account and it was going smoothly the first probably 7 months until Instagram updated and now no one sees my posts. Iím not gaining followers because my posts arenít recommended because IM NOT A BIG ACCOUNT. It honestly irks me to see how my hard work to draw and post almost every day is now basically all for nothing because everything is being handed to the bigger accounts. Smaller accounts are now butted to the side and ignored. There is almost no was of growing. I use hashtags, my story, and I posted regularlyó yet my numbers still decreased with the new update. I feel like it is their way of saying ìdonít promote? Donít grow.î Sorry but not everyone is able to pay for that mess. I just wish everything was fair like it used to be. Why do big app developers always ruin something that was going so good? How can anyone else make it when they arenít given the chances the bigger accounts once were given?
Please, backtrack and return it to how it used to be. Iíve had many other artists also complain and get discouraged because they feel the same way. It may seem like a problem only social media addicted teens would complain about but when you are trying to get out there and get known so that maybe you can have a career out of it, itís a kick to the gut.
Another thing that is annoying is the adds that I donít ask to see. They are very creepy because they relate to the things that I like but thatís not why I got instagram. It seems like this app is trying to copy every other social media app such as Snapchat and Facebook.
I really suggest switching to Vero The True Social App! Been there a few months and I love it. Plus, they arenít as strict as Instagram and you see content from all the people you follow.
I it enjoy Instagram, it is my favorite social media app. I love looking at other people's pictures and staying in touch with family members that are away. It is a source for a lot of my creative inspiration and I love that aspect. All the new tools that Instagram has incorporated into its app are so amazing and helpful. I look forward to the new features that they will one day include in the future. One that I hope they include is the ability it add/edit postures once they have been uploaded. This is something that I struggle with all the time, whenever I'm posting multiple pictures at a time using their sliding picture format, I cannot add onto, delete, or rearrange the order of these photos. I recently just uploaded a pair of two pictures to my page only later to realize that I forgot to add a third photo that I was planning to put. I think it would be helpful if Instagram added an option to edit pictures in such a way that we are permitted to edit captions. I do not wish to delete the whole post, but to simply add one more photo to my post. Instagram please listen to this message for it will help my and several of my other friends who struggle with this same issue!
Used to be a fan
Just wanted to mention to those who are are concerned , that I stopped using Facebook because of the obtrusive nature of Facebook in the use of my data and exploiting it for purposes that I have not agreed to, nor would I... Instagram seemed like an option that was a platform made for users that enjoyed and appreciated each otherís photos and small bits of commentary versus Facebookës rabid feedback loop of everyone including strangers who would be able to comment, and so often disparagingly so, on your content. Instagram at the time, seemed like a mountain lake of peaceful interaction versus the stormy seas that Facebook and itís deluge of content and ads had become. When I started using Instagram there were no ads pushed onto my feedÖ Now there are and not just a few, but regularly inserted into my stream that I follow. Some of these ads have products which according to the reviews, could be from companies that are less than reputableÖ So already itís begun..Facebook in itís march to monetize all aspects that it touches is now slowly but surely souring The Instagram platform with it ads and Iím sure eventually with other products that will supplant what Instagram originally was to be aboutÖ I will use it until I tire of this which could be sooner than laterÖ We shall see.
Instagram as a whole ever since I got it last summer has a been a great experience for me. Iíve been able to connect with my friends faster than I wouldíve without it, and itís a good thing to have when Iím bored and have nothing else to do. However, after having Instagram for many months I have discovered a couple of issues that are driving me nuts. First, on the home page once every so often the several most recent posts get mixed up in a seemingly RANDOM ORDER. I donít like this at all because the post that gets moved to the top is most likely a post that I donít want to see again for a while, like today that post is one that I donít like at all and would rather not see AGAIN, and also because I someone who likes his home page posts to be precisely in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. Second, when an Instagram update comes around, the caption for it should say more than just fixing bugs and issues on Instagram, like what exactly that update is going to do with certain pages on the app and why. Please take the time to deal with these issues that Iíve stated above so that in the near future Iíll be able to confidently give Instagram a FIVE STAR RATING instead of a four star rating.
"While I enjoy this app, I've been using it for 3 years, there are some recent issues that have been bothering me. All the updates have just been going downhill since the chronological order of your feed was removed. My feed is a mess of the same people over and over again with posts from many days ago because instagram thinks I want to see that stuff above everything else. The ""solution"" was to help you stay up to date with the posts you miss, but now I am missing more posts in my feed than before because of this system. I recommend making it an option in settings to turn on chronological order of your feed, it would make things so much easier. Another issue I have is that I recently noticed that the accounts you follow are no longer in chronological order either? There seems to be no organized way they are put in order, it's just like it was randomly thrown in there like that. This proves to be very difficult for me to find accounts I have recently followed as they no longer show up at the top of my followed box. I am following over 1,600 accounts so I have a very hard time remembering the name of an account I just followed. I just wanted to find one account and now it's lost in the many accounts I follow. Please make these changes, it would make the app so much easier "
I had to start using my familyís email with their permission so I could have 2 accounts. I donít understand why you canít have 2 accounts on one email. If o want 10 accounts, I will need 10 emails. That absurd. Can I poxís have an explanation on this.
I installed Instagram because the app said you needed to be 12. I had it for a few months and eventually my posts totaled to about 80. I had taken pictures of holidays, trips, vacations, my family, and my dog. For a while, everything was fine and I loved the app, but then I made another slime account. I made this account and started using both of them. After a few days, I was asked to put in my age for some reason on my first account. The one with all my memories. 
I put it in and the age said I was 12. I then had to try to put in my age a few more times, but I put the same age in. I then was forced off of my first account. I clicked the button to save my pictures, but it didnít work. I was so confused because the app said I needed to be 12, but I got an email saying I had to be thirteen. The app said YOU NEED TO BE 12 NOT 13!!! I was so mad and upset. All of my memories were gone and I couldnít recover my photos. This needs to be fixed and I want my photos back.
Great, but needs some issues fixed.

When I started using Instagram there were no ads pushed onto my feedÖ Now there are and not just a few, but regularly inserted into my stream that I follow. Some of these ads have products which according to the reviews, could be from companies that are less than reputableÖ So already itís begun..
Facebook in itís march to monetize all aspects that it touches is now slowly but surely souring The Instagram platform with it ads and Iím sure eventually with other products that will supplant what Instagram originally was to be aboutÖ I will use it until I tire of this which could be sooner than laterÖ We shall see.
ALSO YOU HAVE DELETED SO MANY OF MY FAVORITE PROFILES because they ìdo not followî your guidelines when they are not breaking rules. I see celebrities get away with posting nudes and inappropriate pictures everyday like Kim kardashian. I also have several spam nude pages that try to follow and harass me that I have to block and report. Please re-evaluate your guidelines because you are ruining influencers lives when you take their platforms away for breaking no rules. Please start implementing your guidelines on celebrities and stop hurting influencers.
Instagram has always been my favorite social media app, however, recently I have had VARIOUS problems due to malfunctions within the app. At the beginning of September 2018, I was logged out of my Instagram account for no reason at all. No big deal, Iíll just log myself back in, right? Wrong. 
Every time I tried to log in it said an error had occurred. I logged into my Instagram through the safari app to make sure my password was correct, and it allowed me to do so. Now knowing that I was using the correct password, I tried again to log into my account through the Instagram app itself. No luck, once again. I contacted Instagram through email and they said there was nothing they could do about the problem. It is now March of 2019 and the problem is still occurring. Instagram needs to fix this situation. Which according to Google, multiple people are facing similar issues as well.
This is a very irritating problem and the Instagram Team just seems to push it to the side. This is not an efficient way to run a company.
