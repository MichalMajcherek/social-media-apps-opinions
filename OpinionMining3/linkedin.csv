"I’m a job seeker and I’ve been using LinkedIn to aid in my search. However, I’m afraid of missing a job opportunity as whenever I get a push notification I never hear any sound, unlike with my other apps. I always see a red number on my LinkedIn app widget showing me how many new notifications I have however I never hear any sound. All other sounds seem to be working which leads me to believe it’s an app issue rather than a phone issue or operator error somewhere. Please help! Thanks!


Also, unless I’m just missing it, I would LOVE the ability to select a custom notification sound within the app so I can identify a LinkedIn notification from all others. Thank you! Be safe!


Oh! One thing I did forget to add is that I LOVE the section called “My Next Job Should Offer Me” where we’re able to specify benefits we’re asking for as well as the schedule we need. Oh and the Name Pronunciation feature is fantastic!!! Thank you!!!

I am a blind person using the screen reader voiceover for iOS and I am having some serious VoiceOver accessibility problems. For one thing, in the new version, when I double tap on my Contacts, the app crashes every time. Secondly, when I am browsing through my people you may know section, the app get slower and slower and slower the longer eyebrows. Thirdly, if you were using voiceover, there is no option to remove someone from your people you may know list so that you do not see them anymore. The accessibility problems with this app used to be somewhat minimal. I am really looking forward to seeing this app fixed and using LinkedIn again. It is one of my favorite social networking platforms. I apologize if other people are bored by this review, but LinkedIn also does not have any where in the app or on the app support page to provide feedback about the app. I would also be kind of nice if developer of LinkedIn provided details about its updates in its release notes, but many App developers don’t do this. It’s just a pet peeve.
I swear this site has provided me with so much stress just trying to set it up. I didn’t dropped out of college and I left my job but they are both in my interests and I cannot change them. Whenever I open the app it tells me to finish updating my profile but I don’t have anymore information to add. There’s no way to say no. When I tried to leave things blank because they don’t apply to me I couldn’t. I got a notice that I had shown up in a search but when I opened the notification I was taken to a page within the app that did not work without a laptop. Why would this happen on the mobile app? It makes no sense. I’ve made all the connections I want to for now but every time I open the app I have to skip through the page to make connections with random people I don’t know. This app and the website are infuriating to attempt to use. I use all kinds of other social media that work at least decently. This platform is by far the most angering to use. Maybe the team is overworked or has no time to fix these issues, but they are too glaring and long lasting to still be around
"I love LinkedIn, but would like to see an unlimited word count. There are so many times that I have a post that exceeds the allotted word count and it’s frustrating. I could condense what i need to say most times, but sometimes I need to be able to say more than what LinkedIn allows.


If the post is good, people will read it. If not, they don’t have to read it and can just scroll on past. I’m sure if you took a poll from other LinkedIn users, you would find that most of them would agree that LinkedIn needs an unlimited word count. Don’t limit it solely for the purpose of making sure people’s posts are shorter. Give people the opportunity to add as much as they need to their posts. Sometimes you need to be able to add more to your post to properly say what you need to say because tightening your word count doesn’t always cut it.

"I too am very disappointed with LinkedIn and the direction it has taken.
This previously was a great site for people to communicate with other people and companies. Whether it was trying to get a job, improving their position, finding a new workplace due to moving to a new area or trying to move up to a better job, talking with others about how to improve their job skills so they can prepare for a better job or keeping in touch with friends they worked with in the past or, even better, finding old friends and learning how to stay in touch with them. It WAS a great site.
Now, as the previous commenter said, LinkedIn is now just another Facebook or Twitter. It’s totally lost all the professionalism it started with.
If anyone in power within the LinkedIn organization reads this comment, please, please, PLEASE change the format back to what the original people or person had as their vision. If you don’t, I can foresee this site going down the tubes. I, for one, will do my best to start a new site with only one goal... to make a website for companies and individuals to get together and help each other grow both as a company and as individuals who want to help a company grow and a company willing to help their dedicated individuals grow within the company.
Also, have learning institutions small and large contribute to the individuals growth.
Is anyone out there with me on this?

"LinkedIn is the absolute worst, corrupt, and non user friendly social app out there. There are too many reasons to even begin mentioning all of them. Just to name one: if a user wants to unfriend or leave a group, LinkedIn intentionally makes it impossible to do so on the mobile app.


I’m also still dealing with a “glitch” that the app had a few years ago. Without giving any permission to access my iPhone’s contacts, LinkedIn automatically dumped every one of my LinkedIn contacts into my iPhone’s contacts. Well over 500 contacts were combined with my personal contacts. Not a big deal you say? Well those contacts birthdays were then automatically also added to iPhone’s calendar. Everyday I would have at least a couple of these birthdays showing. For well over a year I was manually removing these contacts one name at a time. LinkedIn admitted to the error. Thanks that did nothing to help. So at this point I have zero trust in the integrity, honesty, or reliability of LinkedIn.

LinkedIn... I love your platform. I have already posted a comment on the lack of a sort by “recent” function on for iOS. When I’m on my phone, the work around is to go to your mobile site, then request the desktop site, then select “sort by: recent”. The most recent update you just pushed out now has “lives” or something that feels like a clone of Instagram/YouTube/Snapchat/Facebook, etc. I do not subscribe to these platforms because I believe LinkedIn is the only social media platform of any substance. There is quality content and networking happening everyday. Why did your newest update add a cookie-cutter “lives” function and not a simple “sort by:recent” function. Why am I seeing 3 week old posts with recent posts scattered about. Totally ridiculous... The one platform I thought was doing a service to a community of professional people is slowly becoming just another social media platform.
The app is solid and very easy to use. My complaints are the content in the Feed and that the option “improve my feed” really offers no real options except adding new people to follow. It should be flexible and let you choose what you want to see more of OR less of. For example, in my feed I don't need to see every single time a connection “likes” something. I also remember I always used to see when my current connections connected to new people. I used to see those a lot every day. That was helpful info if a contact connected to someone new in my industry. It worked well in conjunction with the other “people I may know” info. I almost never see those types of updates anymore in my feed. Can you explain why the feed offers me zero flexibility to see the things that are most important to me?
The newest update has them limiting your preferences for your job search an forcibly showing you state wide jobs like that helps. If someone like myself has set up job preferences why take them away and why start showing jobs to them that are outside of their preferences like a job search isn't already hard enough and tiring enough. Now I'm every time I open the app instead of being able to scroll through the recommendations I have to create different searches because the jobs recommended to me are 8+ hours away and don't interest me in the slightest. Just because I live in a state doesn't mean I'm comfortable commuting far and doesn't mean I'm trying to relocate to the opposite side of it. So who's dumb idea was it to add that useless and annoying feature that shows jobs to people outside their now very limited preferences. I don't want to be shown state wide jobs and according to the customer service rep it's a feature I can't manually get rid of. Dumbest update to date.
"My LI app will no longer run, I'm forced to upgrade the app, but my iPhone doesn't support the new minimum de for the latest app. Sad LI made that decision to not support earlier sw versions :( and being in transition spending $1k on new phone isn't the smartest idea right now. Laptop only going forward :(


Still abandoned- their support said delete app and reload, there was hope as when I was reloading it said that it would load the sw that was compatible with my phone and that some features may not work. Ha, who knew the feature that wouldn't work was the app itself... they have a screen that comes up stating ""update for the latest sw"" but you can't get out of that loop, my phone doesn't support latest iPhone sw so it can't get the latest LI download. A silly loop they could correct if they wanted, I guess they don't want to, they closed my case because I didn't respond back in the hour, like all I have to do is mess with this app, ugh. Now you know why I feel abandoned...

"This is a perfect example of what NOT to do in mobile app design.
1. Useless messenger button that does nothing but try and get you to download the app by popping not one, but two screens (if you don’t have it). I won’t load Facebook Messenger because it won’t let me select no tracking without constantly being harassed.
2. Extremely small “x” for closing annoying ad windows so that if you have any normal or larger than normal finger (god forbid you try and use your thumb) then you end up opening the item instead.
3. Allowing you to block some advertisers for only 30-Days at a time??? Seriously. If it wasn’t bad enough that you show me adds from advertisers I’ve already blocked, now you’re unblocking them after 30 Days??
4. Extremely small “x” for closing annoying recommended groups windows so that if you have any normal or larger than normal finger (god forbid you try and use your thumb) then you end up opening the item instead. Can I just get you to stop recommending stuff to me? I’m not sure what algorithm you use but the recommendations are horrible.
5. Translations are rarely ever correct. Give up here and just license Google’s translator. I’m not saying Google Translate is good, but it would at least be correct more than your translations are.


There are more, I’m sure. But we will stop here.

Number one, if your application in the Apple IDs door would support a dialog box when selecting apps support I would be writing this in that dialog box and not under reviews. My review is based on the fact that Face ID is not used by LinkedIn. LinkedIn‘s responses leave your app signed in. I do not wish to do that, the information in the app is too private for me to take LinkedIn suggestion. The technology for Face ID has been incorporated to I would say 70 percent of the applications at this point, so it tells me that updating your app to use this functionality cannot be that difficult. I’ll be waiting for the Face ID recognition in your app soon. I would use your out more by not having to manually put in my password, holding the phone to your face makes my motivation to use your application what greater than having to use my large fingers To type in my password. Thank you, John
I downloaded the app again because I thought it would be easier to use on my phone. I’ve been using it for about 30 minutes and it has crashed 3 times. It crashed while I was sending a request to connect. I was attaching a message to this request because the person doesn’t know me. Now, It has sent the request and I can’t finish my message. I don’t know if it attached what I typed already or not. Given that LinkedIn is a tool to help people network and make professional connections, this is more than frustrating. Now, to reach out to this person, I would have to pay for a premium account and use “in mail.” I’ll not be using the app anymore which is a serious inconvenience. I stopped using the Linked In app years ago because it would lead to accidental connection requests while scrolling through searches or suggested connection.
I really like LinkedIn because it’s social media kept professional. A suggestion I’d make that would help recruiters find and connect with talent is to add a salary requirement to the “jobs settings”. I get contacted by so many recruiters and each time they contact me about a position I talk to them for about 30 minutes just to find out they want to offer me a job that pays me 25-50% less than my current salary. It’s a complete waste of my time and the recruiter’s time as well. Another thing I’d recommend is providing recruiters a service that lets them know what is the median salary for the position they are trying to hire for so they understand how much professionals earn in their industry and position
LinkedIn is my preferred way to interact with business professionals. I do, however, wish that the site would allow a longer time to deactivate an account or allow one to restore their account within a year. I deactivated my account for a “spiritual hiatus” and attempted to set my account back up and was unable to retrieve it. I built a great network before and now it seems like I am not getting as many recommendations for people that I knew from college and other businesses. 😏 I’m sure my post sounds like a combination of great things and not so great things, but I do really appreciate the fact that the tool is much more professional than most social media outlets.
Why is the current company name for occupation now forced in the headline with the job title!?!? What about those of us that are currently seeking other jobs while still working at the current position??? This is a terrible thing, we should have the option to not have the company name on our headlines if we don’t want it! So disappointed. I was getting so many job opportunity inbox messages from recruiters with my customized headline before this terrible update, I was wondering why I hadn’t seen any inbox messages recently and now I know why, since you removed my customized headline and added the company I currently work for I don’t standout to recruiters anymore and I’m not getting any leads, my headline looks just like everybody else’s headline therefore recruiters don’t even notice me anymore because my headline doesn’t standout like it use to. Change it back please!
"I’ve heard so many people speak highly of LinkedIn, so I tried it out. Unfortunately this app does NOT work, as it needs serious updates. When you try to apply for any of the job listing your are given the option to give permission to attach your LinkedIn profile in replace or your resume, it does NOT work. Once you click you get a white screen or when it does go through to the next screen where it will ask for your name and contact info it freezes. Therefore you can not apply for any of their job listings. So I look up the company on google to find their website and then apply that way with my own resume.
The only thing LinkedIn is good for right now is to locate a job listing. Then apply on their site.
I gave 1 star because at least they still proved job listing I can apply to on the companies web site directly.
"
In the past when I was contacted by a recruiter in my message inbox, I could respond directly to the recruiter. Now, the app forces you to respond whether or not you are interested in the job before you have a chance to respond. To me this is a 100% unnecessary feature and is an unprofessional way to contact a recruiter to express interest. The right way to treat a recruiter is to write that person directly and let them know your intentions, perhaps including some background for your decision. This can help keep communication channels open in the future and is a networking opportunity. This new feature is a result of someone “overthinking” the situation. This goes back to the old saying, “If its not broke, don't fix it”
I love this app however it frustrates me that the current job title seems to be the only factor that is included when recruiters are delivered search results. As a consultant, my title can be anything and it may be quite different from my functional role and area of expertise. Depending upon the currently listed job title, I’ve noticed a sharp difference in the number contacts I receive from recruiters and the roles they are seeking. I wish that other factors such as education, certifications and skills would be considered when recruiters are delivered search results. Also, LinkedIn should allow subscribers to search by certification or certificate. Currently a search for common certifications returns no results despite the fact that these certifications are listed within job descriptions.
"Not a safe place to have a professional opinion in most professions. Especially if you are a women. LinkedIn does not respect women whom have professional scientific reasoning and professional opinions that vary from the political slant posted by either a member or otherwise linkedin; however LinkedIn will continue to push the political slant into your feed continually inviting you to acknowledge the political topic which is slanted and not academically or professionally sound. If you don’t like it and if you contribute your intelligent, professional and academically sound comment LinkedIn members state hate things to a person such as Members stating hate statement to me and others I have witnessed ). Very disappointed in the lack of professionalism from LinkedIn employees whom allow the members and themselves to be so hateful to women and others on LinkedIn whom state professional scientific academically sound verbiage on a topic."
When Linkedin first introduced an app I’ll admit I was sceptical. I was leery because I’ve experienced many many websites attempting to make life easier with a new app and they fall on their face. This particular app is probably one of the easiest to maneuver and it allows me to stay connected easily with notifications and simple maneuvering around the site. I choose to be a Premier member and the benefits are well worth the money. I love linked in. I’ve become friends worldwide not only for the industry I’m in but also personal friends with multitudes or different interests. Get the app.
The mobile version lacks so many of the desktop version features such as privacy features and profile customization. However, what really bothers me is that LinkedIn uses this difference to their financial advantage so you cannot cancel a Premium subscription from your device even if they allow you to subscribe from your phone easily. You also get no notification when the Premium trial is ending so you get charged abruptly. If you miss the subscription cancellation date, LinkedIn will offer no refunds even if late by an hour!! Really?
"This app constantly crashes on uploading posts with photos and video. The effort that it takes to write a post goes to waste as it crashes more than 90% of the time. I am using iPhone X, so hardware should not be an excuse for this issue. I would like to hear what the developers have to say about the problem. This problem has been an issue for at least last 2 years. I have installed the app multiple time but no luck. I don’t use the app anymore but sometime while traveling I have no other option. I am not sure why such a basic functionality is not resolved on this platform. Is it too hard for LinkedIn to figure this out??
Developers, can you provide me with an answer?
UPDATE 1: Developer asked to submit a ticket on LinkedIn website with app version and iOS version.

"LinkedIn is a great professional app and I love how I can work on my career and look for opportunities using it! Haven’t had any weird glitches with it yet that downgraded my experience.


I do have to deduct some points though for recent changes. The messages button was moved to the upper right and in its place on the bottom middle of the screen is the add a post button. This seems like a worse UI experience because I know I check and respond to messages far more than I post up a message and it’s kinda awkward to move the messages button up there. I also find that I can’t swipe to the right to go back to the last page I was on. Instead, I usually have to tap the back arrow in the upper left, which again, could be improved.

I was new to LinkedIn searching for new leads to jobs as I desperately need to find a new job after 27 years that gave my all. The hospital was bought out by Lahey Health and BI. Long story short I ended up being followed by what I know would turn out to be scams eventually asking for money I’m sure. I deleted one guy cause he made me feel uncomfortable. Then out of the blue 2 more people trying to chat with me. My final straw was when a third person tried to friend me or have conversation. But his profile picture was the person who first chatted with me. Different background picture but it was his face. Freaked me out so I don’t follow LinkedIn like I used to. I just recently had my identity stolen and I’m not going to entertain Catfish type people
"The app has been developed nicely and is very user friendly. Everything’s great. There’s one feature that would really help out,
I am usually/mostly at work and have less time to watch videos, if there was a feature where I could save it to view later that would be amazing, I could just save the video/video link and go home and watch it instead of scrolling down and search for that post. Just like facebook app has the option to save the videos/video link to a certain ‘watch later’ folder.
I really expect the team to work on it.
Other than that, it’s good. Kudos to the developers!

"I think of LinkedIn as business knowledge career centric Facebook. Unlike Facebook, it tends to be more professional with less negative behavior. The feeds while not as well organized as Facebook, tend to provide more useful or pertinent information. A premium subscription is useful if you're actively looking for a job or you want to make use of LinkedIn Learning to improve your skill sets. The mobile version of LinkedIn is much less cluttered than the desktop version although I noticed I see promoted posts (adverts) even though I have premium; not sure if that's a bug or premium doesn't prevent adverts."
"I always use this app, however it’s not without its issues. I’ve contacted customer support about the number of jobs I’ve applied to being way off. This makes it difficult for tracking. After several of the same responses I always get from them whenever an issue is raised, “did you try deleting and reinstalling?” “What version and medium of the app are you using?”


I’ve listed screenshots, very detailed notes that answers all that but it’s always the same generic questions they read off of like a script. Finally, I got a message that said, “we’re aware of the issue but are not pursuing a resolution right now.”


So when it comes to tracking the specific jobs I’ve applied to, it’s a complete wash.

"Don’t plan on an easy time keeping track of the jobs you’ve applied for. I had applied for at least a dozen jobs. A couple days later I went to look for more jobs and check on the jobs I had already applied to. But under the “Jobs Applied” tab, there were ZERO jobs listed. Oh and I’m pretty sure I looked like an idiot when I accidentally applied for the same job twice since LinkedIn doesn’t tell you if you applied for the job yet or not.


I emailed customer service and they took a week to get back to me. Here is the response:
“Please note that only when you apply for Easy apply jobs. If you are applying Jobs on the external website, it will not show up in the applied Jobs section.

I love LinkedIn as an app however lately - over the last few months - the app has become so slow it’s almost unusable. Simple searches that used to return response in seconds now take minutes and often throw an error and don’t come back at all. Pretty much any action off the main landing page has not worked for me, returning the “oops it’s not you it’s us” error and it happens across mobile app and website. Often times I get the never ending spinner, with an ultimate failure error message. While I love LinkedIn - it’s not working - and hasn’t for weeks and I haven’t seen any acknowledgment of the issue which I have to imagine is widespread. Send help! Also please note that I installed the latest app on iPhone XR but no change :(
I am trying to connect to a lot of fitness professionals and it takes 10+ minutes for the requests to send after I clicked on it. Then if I switch screens it stops sending them. So I have to resend requests over and over. It also covers up the search bar so I can’t do anything else. Then when clicking the little circles to add someone it always will jump to their page because my fingers are too fat maybe making it less sensitive around the circle or making it a bigger button would be better. It just is a nuisance and I can’t get back because the back button is covered up by the requests being sent pop up. Fix those problems and I’d say 5 star.
I was tricked into paying $135(!!!) for a “premium” subscription that has absolutely no value to me. I assumed that the free trial would end because I never received a single email or notification about the upcoming subscription renewal after signing up for a free trial last month. I tried to find a place to cancel the subscription in the app and on the website with no luck. Now LinkedIn refuses to refund the payment. I am appalled. For a company that feigns interest in professional success, they have absolutely no sense of what providing good customer service entails. Auto renewing an expensive subscription without notice and without asking for permission is sneaky and conniving. Then refusing to refund the payment is insane. I am severely disappointed in LinkedIn and will be sure to warn my employees, colleagues, and friends.
"Although a majority of the individuals I have connected with through this app respect the Proper use of the app to connect with others that wish to be connected with.
There are a select few that feel this tool is best used for making cold sales calls.
My issue is this there is no way in this app to report they are using your email address and emailing you separate of the LinkedIn app in an effort to get you to buy or purchase one of their products.
The way they behave on LinkedIn may not violate the terms and conditions but there is no way to identify The problem of a separate email from your connection to the folks at Linkedin so they can’t go about dealing with them appropriately

I lived LinkedIn until a few weeks ago when I started getting notifications and solicitation from them via my work email asking if I wanted to join our network. After joining, it didn’t make sense to me to have two professional LinkedIn accounts. Of course my personal account was more prominent with a complete profile and a vast network. Once I merged the accounts, that all disappeared!!! I was left with the account attached to my work email and no profile. I’ve been looking on the website to see if I can get this corrected, but as in most cases there isn’t a was to get “LinkedIn” to a real person!!! Not sure if I even want to re-build another profile and network!
Although the app is good in general, it just constantly fails to load contents. The different pages either don’t update or load partially or just don’t load at all! Sometimes I want to type a message to someone or update my profile, only to find out later that the message was lost or the updates were not made. It’s happening on both my iPhone and iPad. I’ve contacted the support team several times, each time they seem to fix the problem but only for a few days. It keeps coming back! I’m even a premium member but that doesn’t seem to make any difference, it’s just so frustrating. I’m starting to use other means like Glassdoor more and more... Conclusion: the app can be great but for me it’s totally unreliable, I just can’t recommend it for anyone who needs to seriously work with it.
The app is generally the only way I interact with LinkedIn, and it works well for what I need it. However, while I appreciate the alerts most of the time, ever since this last update I've gotten alerts several times a day. When opening the app, the alert ends up asking me if I know someone... And it's been the same individual every single time. And every time, I dismiss it because I don't know them. It's gotten to the point where I seriously want to turn off alerts for the app, which would significantly decrease it's usefulness. Up until this last update, it was just fine. Now it's begging for attention that I really don't want to give it
"I use LinkedIn on my Mac computer all the time and used to be signed in to the app on my previous iPhone. When getting a new phone, every other app was able to use facial detection to let me sign in, while LinkedIn was the ONLY app to reject my facial recognition and force me to take a “not a robot” test to collect AI data on if users can identify pictures. Is it necessary for me to take this free data AI collection test for Microsoft/LinkedIn over and over again every time I get my password wrong. Is there a reason why this is the only app that won’t accept my facial recognition, while every other app does, when moving from Mac to my iPhone to log in???


So annoying and ridiculous. Stop taking advantage of your users by forcing us to take AI tests for you to collect data.

"LinkedIn is wonderful and I’ve loved the website for almost two decades and I’ve loved the app for years. Well, that is until recently. Over the past few months, it does nothing but crash, crash, crash! Every time I do anything more than browse through newsfeeds or search for profiles/jobs, it crashes. Try to write an article on the app...crash! Try to apply to a job...almost always crashes! Try to download or save something from the app....I can guarantee it will crash!


Please get this fixed so everyone from baby boomers to millennials and today’s college kiddos can utilize LinkedIn where they need it most....on their mobile device. Many thanks!

There are so many professionals at your fingertips like for example, I am a professional singer and I have access to contacting via messenger or adding them people like CEO of universal studio recording studio label and def jam’Atlantic records and there are DJ’s and producers and a lot more then this. I also want to mention the groups you can be added to like universal artist group,where you can post your music for all executives all 33,000 in the group to see your stuff and also work with top professionals if your serious about getting a foot in the door at any company this app is the place to be ....much love LinkedIn
"Just opened Facebook, I mean Instagram, oh no I mean LinkedIn. The latest update has remodeled the user interface to make it appear more like Facebook or Instagram. I have always loved the professionalism of LinkedIn and the feature that made it less like a social network. I’m not here for peoples live videos but more for professional opinions, relationships, and experiences.


I am a multiple-times-a-day user, frequently browsing my industry network and making new and valuable connections. That won’t be as easy anymore with the latest move by LinkedIn to conform to the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn.


Would love to learn more about the intelligence and user surveys that led to this latest change because they were obviously flawed.

"I've turned off notifications for everything except the few things I care about (invitations to connect, messages, anything else that pertains directly to me). I still receive push notifications for superfluous events like ""trending news articles"" on a daily basis. The app is designed to have as many notification types as possible, and I've turned off more obscure notifications than I can remember. If you turn one off, the notification settings linked from the dismissed message only shows you what you've turned off, with no option to turn off all the other notifications you'll eventually receive. Completely irresponsible and annoying. I'll be reserving LinkedIn for the desktop from now on."
I give up... What happened to the swipe feature to ignore/delete people whom I don’t want to send an invite to??
"Update: I can’t send the screenshots to you with the glitch through this app. I’ve emailed you through the actual desktop site with this problem, asking for an email address to show you this issue. Nothing has changed and no one has contacted me. App will be deleted.


I turned off all notifications because I was getting too many. I was tired of it. Now, I get a notification that I have no notifications set up. That’s. The. Point. Stop with this ridiculous amount of notifications. Fix it, otherwise, I’m deleting the app altogether.

Before I start.. this is more a review for Apple/iTunes subscription practices than LinkedIn.. so everywhere you see LinkedIn, you can basically fill-in any auto renewal subscription app.. WATCH OUT!! If you’re interested in trying out the free Premium version, you better be paying attention because if you’re not, you're going to slapped with the $65 monthly subscription charge before you even figure out what the difference is between Premium and the free version! I can think of a TON of other things I’d rather spend $65 on! And if you do get charged, GOOD LUCK getting Apple/iTunes to issue you a refund... I think they literally flip a coin. You’re likely stuck with another 30 days. Maybe you can use the extra 30 days figure out the difference..SOUR APPLE!
So I want to update my profile picture, but every time I try, it readjusts the color of the photo, and makes it super dark. No matter what image I select. I’ve tried several times and closing the app and taking it off, and it continues to do it. Definitely a minor issue, but annoying for sure. Other than that, I absolutely love LinkedIn. It’s an easy, fun way to connect to the business world and to network and build relationships across different markets and industries. It’s an absolute genius of a Social Media platform. Kudos to its creators. (Now I only wish the premium was cheaper 😂)
First and most importantly, there should be a rate/review a company option! This would allow current, past & possible new candidates transparent reviews about every company! A competitor, Glassdoor has this feature! Past associates would be able to shine light on issues they encountered while working there as well. Secondly, what’s with the constant LinkedIn members flooding message inbox to get one to go premium? I would like a notification feature where I can more easily tell when I have new messages that way I can keep track and respond in a more timely fashion! Many messages from employers are lost in the shuffle of my LinkedIn messages overall.
The evil money-grabbers at LinkedIn have removed the ability to message for free somebody who has requested to join your network. For privacy and security it is necessary that we be able to message these people to make sure they are who they say they are or if we don’t recognize them, to ask them where we know them from. As a free user I am now forced to accept the connection before sending the message, exposing my personal info to a potential stranger. The goblins as LinkedIn need to value our privacy and security over our money by reenabling the reply (don’t accept yet) option on connection requests. If you agree, please also give a one star review (you can even copy and paste mine) so we can inform LinkedIn that they cannot get away with this
I started my account 6 years ago in hopes it would help me land a new job. I found a new job but no thanks to LinkedIn (another web based job site helped with that). The content consists mostly of posts from people shamelessly promoting themselves or from people trying to spin their videos of children or animals into some kind of life altering message. Now the geniuses (at LinkedIn) are taking it upon themselves to change my chosen location on my profile unless I tell them not to. That’s seriously messed up. How about suggesting I change it? What’s really disturbing is that my phone does not show any location services that can be switched off on the app. Honestly thinking about deleting.
I spent 20 minutes looking for a way to provide app feedback on the app and on the website to no avail. Regardless, this is the actual feedback - I have been missing messages since I turned off badges. When I turned badges on to address this, I was inundated with LinkedIn's notification happy feed. I would like to see these things when I log in, but not interested in them being included in the badge alert count. My only option was to turn off badges and revert to email notifications for new messages. It seems like a missed opportunity, and even more so if they make it impossible for those interested in improving the platform to provide feedback.
"LInkedIn is a dangerous product. Users beware. I recently discovered that without any authorization from me or from anyone with access to my Apple devices, they have been charging me almost $100 per month for something called Premium Business. I was able to submit a request for refund but for only the past two months via Apple support. But Apple advise that only two months can be refunded even though LInkedIn apparently began charging me monthly in December 2019. The LinkedIn website gives no means for canceling or requesting refund for charges that are apparently fraudulent - due to some LinkedIn mistake.


Apparently the Premium Business account is for corporations, not for retired individuals with very limited income and no need for any LinkedIn Premium Services.

"I got lots of people connect to me. I used to be able to accept most of hem quickly and now it kept pop up suggestions. Is annoying and interpreting the task I was trying to complete. Hate it. Please remove it!


Also, you should have a function to allow people to make note to the connection and also auto record when I connect. eg I go to conference today so everyone I added today is from the conference. The pain point is that you don't remember where and how you met the person. Or when you go to conference, you add tons of people, when you are home and trying to recall who you met today, you open your LinkedIn, there is no easy way to find them anymore!
